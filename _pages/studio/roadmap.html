                            Here you will find a very high level roadmap for the Apicurio Studio project. The details are subject to change,
                            but this page can provide a basic sense of the project's priorities and releases. Additional information can typically
                            be found on <a href="{{ site.github_url }}/issues">GitHub</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The intention is to release new versions of the Apicurio Studio very frequently.  This roadmap represents a high
                            level set of features that make up a given release series (for example, <strong>Beta</strong>.  The list of tasks
                            for each release series is an indication of the work to be done in that series, but not an implication of the order
                            in which that work will be done.  Finally, we will not wait until <strong>all</strong> of the tasks are complete,
                            but will instead release iteratively as soon as useful functionality is completed.
