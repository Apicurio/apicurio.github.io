                        <p>
                            The Apicurio Data Models library is a Java and Typescript compatible library that provides
                            reading, writing, analysis, modification, and validation of OpenAPI and AsyncAPI documents.
                            Use this library if you need to support either OpenAPI or AsyncAPI specifications in your
                            own projects.

                        <p>
                            The Apicurio Data Models library is written in Java and then transpiled to Typescript using
                            the very nice <a href="http://www.jsweet.org/">JSweet Utility</a>.  This results in the
                            library being released both as a standard Maven library (and released into Maven Central)
                            as well as a javascript module released into <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/apicurio-data-models">npmjs.com</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The JSweet tool does a great job with the transpilation, allowing us to have a very thin
                            "compatibility" layer (check out the
                            <a href="https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-data-models/tree/main/src/main/java/io/apicurio/datamodels/compat">io.apicurio.datamodels.compat</a>
                            Java package) to isolate functionality that cannot be transpiled from Java to Typescript.
                            In addition, we have a very comprehensive set of unit tests that are designed to run in both
                            the Java and Typescript builds.  This is critical as it allows us to be very confident
                            that the library behaves the same in both runtime environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The motivation for writing this library in this way is because the Apicurio Studio project
                            requires this data modeling functionality in both the Java back-end layer <b>and</b> the
                            browser front-end layer.  As a result, this library is actually heavily used in both forms
                            and is not just a novelty.
