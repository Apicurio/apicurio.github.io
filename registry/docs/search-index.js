This document also explains how to enforce schemas using Kafka client serializers and deserializers in your consumer and producer applications. It also describes Apicurio Registry content types and rule types, and OpenShift environment variables for health checks. See the Apicurio Registry and Apicurio Registry Operator projects on GitHub. Any contributions, suggestions, and issue reports are welcome. Create an issue on GitHub if you find any problems.","title":"Apicurio Registry documentation","component":"apicurio-registry","version":"3.1.x","name":"index","url":"/apicurio-registry/3.1.x/index.html","titles":[{"text":"About this documentation","id":"_about_this_documentation"},{"text":"Getting help with Apicurio Registry","id":"_getting_help_with_apicurio_registry"}]},"/apicurio-registry/3.1.x/getting-started/assembly-artifact-reference.html":{"text":"This chapter provides reference information on the supported artifact types, states, and metadata that are stored in Apicurio Registry.

You can store and manage a wide range of schema and API artifact types in Apicurio Registry. Table 1. Apicurio Registry artifact types Type Description Supported versions ASYNCAPI AsyncAPI specification 2.0.0 → 2.6.0, 3.0.0 AVRO Apache Avro schema 1.0 → 1.12, GRAPHQL GraphQL schema * JSON JSON Schema draft-04, draft-07, 2019-09, 2020-12 KCONNECT Apache Kafka Connect schema 2.0.0 OPENAPI OpenAPI specification 2.0.0, 3.0.0 → 3.0.3, 3.1.0 PROTOBUF Google protocol buffers schema proto2, proto3 WSDL Web Services Definition Language http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/ XML Extensible Markup Language XSD XML Schema Definition http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema The valid artifact version states in Apicurio Registry are ENABLED, DISABLED, and DEPRECATED. Table 2. Apicurio Registry artifact version states State Description ENABLED Basic state, all the operations are available. DISABLED The artifact version metadata is viewable and searchable using the Apicurio Registry web console, but its content cannot be fetched by any client. DEPRECATED The artifact version is fully usable but a header is added to the REST API response whenever the artifact version content is fetched. When a group is created in Apicurio Registry, a set of metadata properties is created and stored. This metadata consists of system-generated or user-generated properties that are read-only, and editable properties that you can update after the group is created. Table 3. Apicurio Registry system-generated metadata Property Type Description owner string The name of the user who created the group. createdOn date The date and time when the group was created, for example, 2023-10-11T14:15:28Z. modifiedBy string The name of the user who modified the group. modifiedOn date The date and time at which the group was modified, for example, 2023-10-11T14:15:28Z.

Apicurio Registry user-provided or system-generated metadata Property Type Description groupId string Unique identifier of the artifact group in Apicurio Registry, for example, development or production. Table 5. Apicurio Registry editable metadata Property Type Description description string Optional meaningful description of the group, for example, This is a simple group for testing. labels map Optional list of user-defined name-value pairs associated with the group. The name and value must be strings, for example, my-key and my-value. Updating group metadata You can use the Apicurio Registry REST API or web console to update the set of editable metadata properties. You can update the state property only by using the Apicurio Registry REST API. Additional resources For more details, see the /groups/{groupId} endpoint in the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. When an artifact is added to Apicurio Registry, a set of metadata properties is created and stored. This metadata consists of system-generated or user-generated properties that are read-only, and editable properties that you can update after the artifact is created. Table 6. Apicurio Registry system-generated metadata Property Type Description createdOn date The date and time when the artifact was created, for example, 2023-10-11T14:15:28Z. globalId integer Globally unique identifier of an artifact version in Apicurio Registry. For example, a global ID of 1 is assigned to the first artifact version created in Apicurio Registry. modifiedBy string The name of the user who modified the artifact. modifiedOn date The date and time at which the artifact was modified, for example, 2023-10-11T14:15:28Z. Table 7. Apicurio Registry user-provided or system-generated metadata Property Type Description groupId string Unique identifier of an artifact group in Apicurio Registry, for example, development or production. When creating an artifact by using the Apicurio Registry web console, if you do not provide a group ID, this is set to default. You must provide a group ID when using the Apicurio Registry REST API, Java client, or Maven plug-in. artifactId string Unique identifier of an artifact in Apicurio Registry. You can provide an artifact ID or use the UUID generated by Apicurio Registry, for example, 8d168cad-1865-4e6c-bb7e-04e8be005bea. Different versions of an artifact use the same artifact ID, but have different global IDs. artifactType ArtifactType The supported artifact type, for example, AVRO, OPENAPI, or PROTOBUF. Table 8. Apicurio Registry editable metadata Property Type Description name string Optional human-readable name of the artifact, for example, My first Avro schema. description string Optional meaningful description of the artifact, for example, This is a simple OpenAPI for testing. labels map Optional list of user-defined name-value pairs associated with the artifact. The name and value must be strings, for example, my-key and my-value. owner string The name of the user who owns the artifact. Updating artifact metadata You can use the Apicurio Registry REST API or web console to update the set of editable metadata properties. Additional resources For more details, see the /groups/{groupId}/artifacts/{artifactId} endpoint in the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. When an artifact version is added to a Apicurio Registry artifact, a set of metadata properties is created and stored along with the artifact version content. This metadata consists of system-generated or user-generated properties that are read-only, and editable properties that you can update after the artifact version is created. Table 9.

Each request will be counted only once, i.e. either as the specific status code or in the general category. apicurio.metrics.rest.method-tag-enabled boolean true 3.1.1 Add the HTTP method tag/label on REST API request metrics. You might disable this tag to reduce metrics cardinality. apicurio.metrics.rest.path-filter-pattern string /apis/.* 3.1.1 Only requests with a path matching this pattern (Java syntax) will be considered for metrics collection. The pattern is applied to the request path only, e.g. curl 'http://localhost:8080/apis/registry/v3/groups/default/artifacts?offset=42&limit=10' will be matched against /apis/registry/v3/groups/default/artifacts. apicurio.metrics.rest.path-tag-enabled boolean true 3.1.1 Add the unsubstituted path tag/label on REST API request metrics, e.g. /apis/registry/v3/groups/{groupId}/artifacts/{artifactId}. You might disable this tag to reduce metrics cardinality. When an unsubstituted REST API resource path could not be determined, the tag value will be (unspecified). quarkus.otel.enabled boolean true 3.1.7 Enable or disable OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, metrics export via OTLP, and log correlation. When enabled, Apicurio Registry exports telemetry data to an OpenTelemetry collector. quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint string http://localhost:4317 3.1.7 The endpoint URL of the OpenTelemetry collector.

Useful for tracing in KafkaSQL storage deployments. quarkus.otel.logs.enabled boolean true 3.1.7 BUILD-TIME property to enable log export via OpenTelemetry. When enabled along with JSON logging, trace context is automatically included in log entries. Use quarkus.otel.sdk.disabled to control log export at runtime. quarkus.otel.metrics.enabled boolean true 3.1.7 BUILD-TIME property to enable metrics export via OpenTelemetry. This works alongside existing Prometheus metrics export. Use quarkus.otel.sdk.disabled to control metrics at runtime. quarkus.otel.resource.attributes string 3.1.7 Additional resource attributes to include in telemetry data, specified as comma-separated key=value pairs. Example: service.version=3.0.0,deployment.environment=production quarkus.otel.sdk.disabled boolean true 3.1.7 Disable the OpenTelemetry SDK at runtime. Set to false to enable OpenTelemetry. This is the primary runtime control for enabling/disabling all telemetry signals. quarkus.otel.service.name string apicurio-registry 3.1.7 The logical service name for this Apicurio Registry instance. This name appears in traces and metrics exported to the OpenTelemetry collector. quarkus.otel.traces.enabled boolean true 3.1.7 BUILD-TIME property to enable distributed tracing instrumentation. When enabled, Apicurio Registry creates spans for REST API requests and storage operations. Use quarkus.otel.sdk.disabled to control tracing at runtime. quarkus.otel.traces.sampler string parentbased_always_on 3.1.7 The sampling strategy for traces. Use parentbased_always_on for development or parentbased_traceidratio for production to reduce overhead. quarkus.otel.traces.sampler.arg string 1.0 3.1.7 The sampling ratio when using parentbased_traceidratio sampler. A value of 0.1 means 10% of traces are sampled. Table 12. redirects configuration options Name Type Default Available from Description apicurio.redirects map 2.1.2.Final Registry redirects apicurio.redirects.enabled boolean 2.1.2.Final Enable redirects apicurio.url.override.host optional 2.5.0.Final Override the hostname used for generating externally-accessible URLs. The host and port overrides are useful when deploying Registry with HTTPS passthrough Ingress or Route. In cases like these, the request URL (and port) that is then re-used for redirection does not belong to actual external URL used by the client, because the request is proxied. The redirection then fails because the target URL is not reachable. apicurio.url.override.port optional 2.5.0.Final Override the port used for generating externally-accessible URLs. Table 13. rest configuration options Name Type Default Available from Description apicurio.rest.artifact.download.max-size.bytes int 1000000 2.2.6 Max size of the artifact allowed to be downloaded from URL apicurio.rest.artifact.download.ssl-validation.disabled boolean false 2.2.6 Skip SSL validation when downloading artifacts from URL apicurio.rest.deletion.artifact-version.enabled boolean [dynamic] false 2.4.2 Enables artifact version deletion apicurio.rest.deletion.artifact.enabled boolean [dynamic] false 3.0.0 Enables artifact deletion apicurio.rest.deletion.group.enabled boolean [dynamic] false 3.0.0 Enables group deletion apicurio.rest.mutability.artifact-version-content.enabled boolean [dynamic] false 3.0.2 Enables artifact version mutability apicurio.rest.search-results.labels.max-size.bytes int 512 3.0.3 Max size of the labels (in bytes) per item from within search results Table 14. semver configuration options Name Type Default Available from Description apicurio.semver.branching.coerce boolean [dynamic] false 3.0.0 If true, invalid versions will be coerced to Semantic Versioning 2 format (https://semver.org) if possible. apicurio.semver.branching.enabled boolean [dynamic] false 3.0.0 Automatically create or update branches for major ('A.x') and minor ('A.B.x') artifact versions. apicurio.semver.validation.enabled boolean [dynamic] false 3.0.0 Validate that all artifact versions conform to Semantic Versioning 2 format (https://semver.org).

Fully-qualified Java classname that implements SchemaResolver. String io.apicurio.registry.resolver.DefaultSchemaResolver The DefaultSchemaResolver is recommended and provides useful features for most use cases. For some advanced use cases, you might use a custom implementation of SchemaResolver. You can use the DefaultSchemaResolver to configure features such as: Access to the registry API How to look up artifacts in the registry How to write and read artifact information to and from Kafka Fall-back options for deserializers The DefaultSchemaResolver provides the following properties to configure access to the core registry API: Table 2.

You can configure application properties as Java system properties or include them in the Quarkus application.properties file. For more details, see the Quarkus documentation. When using schemas in your Kafka client applications, you must choose which specific schema type to use, depending on your use case. Apicurio Registry provides SerDe Java classes for Apache Avro, JSON Schema, and Google Protobuf. The following sections explain how to configure Kafka applications to use each type. You can also use Kafka to implement custom serializer and deserializer classes, and leverage Apicurio Registry functionality using the Apicurio Registry REST Java client. Using the SerDe classes provided by Apicurio Registry in your Kafka application involves setting the correct configuration properties. The following simple Avro examples show how to configure a serializer in a Kafka producer application and how to configure a deserializer in a Kafka consumer application. Example serializer configuration in a Kafka producer // Create the Kafka producer private static Producer createKafkaProducer() { Properties props = new Properties(); // Configure standard Kafka settings props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, SERVERS); props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.CLIENT_ID_CONFIG, \"Producer-\" + TOPIC_NAME); props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.ACKS_CONFIG, \"all\"); // Use Apicurio Registry-provided Kafka serializer for Avro props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName()); props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, AvroKafkaSerializer.class.getName()); // Configure the Apicurio Registry location props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.REGISTRY_URL, REGISTRY_URL); // Register the schema artifact if not found in the registry. props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.AUTO_REGISTER_ARTIFACT, Boolean.TRUE); // Create the Kafka producer Producer producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props); return producer; } Example deserializer configuration in a Kafka consumer // Create the Kafka consumer private static KafkaConsumer createKafkaConsumer() { Properties props = new Properties(); // Configure standard Kafka settings props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, SERVERS); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, \"Consumer-\" + TOPIC_NAME); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG, \"true\"); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_COMMIT_INTERVAL_MS_CONFIG, \"1000\"); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, \"earliest\"); // Use Apicurio Registry-provided Kafka deserializer for Avro props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName()); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, AvroKafkaDeserializer.class.getName()); // Configure the Apicurio Registry location props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.REGISTRY_URL, REGISTRY_URL); // No other configuration needed because the schema globalId the deserializer uses is sent // in the payload. The deserializer extracts the globalId and uses it to look up the schema // from the registry. // Create the Kafka consumer KafkaConsumer consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props); return consumer; } Additional resources For an example application, see the Simple Avro example This topic explains how to use the Kafka client serializer and deserializer (SerDes) classes for Apache Avro. Apicurio Registry provides the following Kafka client SerDes classes for Avro: io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro.AvroKafkaSerializer io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro.AvroKafkaDeserializer Configure the Avro serializer You can configure the Avro serializer class with the following: Apicurio Registry URL Artifact resolver strategy ID location ID encoding Avro datum provider Avro encoding ID location The serializer passes the unique ID of the schema as part of the Kafka message so that consumers can use the correct schema for deserialization. The ID can be in the message payload or in the message headers. The default location is the message payload. To send the ID in the message headers, set the following configuration property: props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.ENABLE_HEADERS, \"true\") The property name is apicurio.registry.headers.enabled. ID encoding You can customize how the schema ID is encoded when passing it in the Kafka message body. Set the apicurio.registry.id-handler configuration property to a class that implements the io.apicurio.registry.serde.IdHandler interface. Apicurio Registry provides the following implementations: io.apicurio.registry.serde.Default4ByteIdHandler: Stores the ID as an 4-byte long io.apicurio.registry.serde.Legacy8ByteIdHandler: Stores the ID as an 8-byte integer Apicurio Registry represents the schema ID as a long, but for legacy reasons, or for compatibility with other registries or SerDe classes, you might want to use 4 bytes when sending the ID. Avro datum provider Avro provides different datum writers and readers to write and read data. Apicurio Registry supports three different types: Generic Specific Reflect The Apicurio Registry AvroDatumProvider is the abstraction of which type is used, where DefaultAvroDatumProvider is used by default. You can set the following configuration options: apicurio.registry.avro-datum-provider: Specifies a fully-qualified Java class name of the AvroDatumProvider implementation, for example io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro.ReflectAvroDatumProvider apicurio.registry.use-specific-avro-reader: Set to true to use a specific type when using DefaultAvroDatumProvider Avro encoding When using Avro to serialize data, you can use the Avro binary encoding format to ensure the data is encoded in as efficient a format as possible. Avro also supports encoding the data as JSON, which makes it easier to inspect the payload of each message, for example, for logging or debugging. You can set the Avro encoding by configuring the apicurio.registry.avro.encoding property with a value of JSON or BINARY. The default is BINARY. Configure the Avro deserializer You must configure the Avro deserializer class to match the following configuration settings of the serializer: Apicurio Registry URL ID encoding Avro datum provider Avro encoding See the serializer section for these configuration options. The property names and values are the same. The following options are not required when configuring the deserializer: Artifact resolver strategy ID location The deserializer class can determine the values for these options from the message. The strategy is not required because the serializer is responsible for sending the ID as part of the message. The ID location is determined by checking for the magic byte at the start of the message payload. If that byte is found, the ID is read from the message payload using the configured handler. If the magic byte is not found, the ID is read from the message headers. Avro SerDes and artifact references When working with Avro messages and a schema with nested records, a new artifact is registered per nested record. For example, the following TradeKey schema includes a nested Exchange schema: TradeKey schema with nested Exchange schema { \"namespace\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.trade\", \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"TradeKey\", \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"exchange\", \"type\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.common.Exchange\" }, { \"name\": \"key\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } Exchange schema { \"namespace\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.common\", \"type\": \"enum\", \"name\": \"Exchange\", \"symbols\" : [\"GEMINI\"] } When using these schemas with Avro SerDes, two artifacts are created in Apicurio Registry, one for the TradeKey schema and one for the Exchange schema. Whenever a message using the TradeKey schema is serialized or deserialized, both schemas are retrieved, allowing you to split your definitions into different files. Additional resources For more details on Avro configuration, see the AvroSerdeConfig Java class For Java example applications, see: Simple Avro example SerDes with references example This topic explains how to use the Kafka client serializer and deserializer (SerDes) classes for JSON Schema. Apicurio Registry provides the following Kafka client SerDes classes for JSON Schema: io.apicurio.registry.serde.jsonschema.JsonSchemaKafkaSerializer io.apicurio.registry.serde.jsonschema.JsonSchemaKafkaDeserializer Unlike Apache Avro, JSON Schema is not a serialization technology, but is instead a validation technology. As a result, configuration options for JSON Schema are quite different. For example, there is no encoding option, because data is always encoded as JSON. Configure the JSON Schema serializer You can configure the JSON Schema serializer class as follows: Apicurio Registry URL Artifact resolver strategy Schema validation The only non-standard configuration property is JSON Schema validation, which is enabled by default. You can disable this by setting apicurio.registry.serde.validation-enabled to \"false\". For example: props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.VALIDATION_ENABLED, Boolean.FALSE) Configure the JSON Schema deserializer You can configure the JSON Schema deserializer class as follows: Apicurio Registry URL Schema validation Class for deserializing data You must provide the location of Apicurio Registry so that the schema can be loaded. The other configuration is optional. Deserializer validation only works if the serializer passes the global ID in the Kafka message, which will only happen when validation is enabled in the serializer. JSON Schema SerDes and artifact references The JSON Schema SerDes cannot discover the schema from the message payload, so the schema artifact must be registered beforehand, and this also applies artifact references. Depending on the content of the schema, if the $ref value is a URL, the SerDes try to resolve the referenced schema using that URL, and then validation works as usual, validating the data against the main schema, and validating the nested value against the nested schema. Support for referencing artifacts in Apicurio Registry has also been implemented. For example, the following citizen.json schema references the city.json schema: citizen.json schema with reference to city.json schema { \"$id\": \"https://example.com/citizen.schema.json\", \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\", \"title\": \"Citizen\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"firstName\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The citizen's first name.\" }, \"lastName\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The citizen's last name.\" }, \"age\": { \"description\": \"Age in years which must be equal to or greater than zero.\", \"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0 }, \"city\": { \"$ref\": \"city.json\" } } } city.json schema { \"$id\": \"https://example.com/city.schema.json\", \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\", \"title\": \"City\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The city's name.\" }, \"zipCode\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"The zip code.\", \"minimum\": 0 } } } In this example, a given citizen has a city. In Apicurio Registry, a citizen artifact with a reference to the city artifact is created using the name city.json. In the SerDes, when the citizen schema is fetched, the city schema is also fetched because it is referenced from the citizen schema. When serializing/deserializing data, the reference name is used to resolve the nested schema, allowing validation against the citizen schema and the nested city schema. Additional resources For more details, see the JsonSchemaKafkaDeserializerConfig Java class For Java example applications, see: Simple JSON Schema example SerDes with references example This topic explains how to use the Kafka client serializer and deserializer (SerDes) classes for Google Protobuf. Apicurio Registry provides the following Kafka client SerDes classes for Protobuf: io.apicurio.registry.serde.protobuf.ProtobufKafkaSerializer io.apicurio.registry.serde.protobuf.ProtobufKafkaDeserializer Configure the Protobuf serializer You can configure the Protobuf serializer class as follows: Apicurio Registry URL Artifact resolver strategy ID location ID encoding Schema validation For details on these configuration options, see the following sections: Apicurio Registry serializer/deserializer configuration in client applications Configure Avro SerDes with Apicurio Registry Configure the Protobuf deserializer You must configure the Protobuf deserializer class to match the following configuration settings in the serializer: Apicurio Registry URL ID encoding The configuration property names and values are the same as for the serializer. The following options are not required when configuring the deserializer: Artifact resolver strategy ID location The deserializer class can determine the values for these options from the message. The strategy is not required because the serializer is responsible for sending the ID as part of the message. The ID location is determined by checking for the magic byte at the start of the message payload. If that byte is found, the ID is read from the message payload using the configured handler. If the magic byte is not found, the ID is read from the message headers. The Protobuf deserializer does not deserialize to your exact Protobuf Message implementation, but rather to a DynamicMessage instance. There is no appropriate API to do otherwise. Protobuf SerDes and artifact references When a complex Protobuf message with an import statement is used, the imported Protobuf messages are stored in Apicurio Registry as separate artifacts. Then when Apicurio Registry gets the main schema to check a Protobuf message, the referenced schemes are also retrieved so the full message schema can be checked and serialized. For example, the following table_info.proto schema file includes the imported mode.proto schema file: table_info.proto file with imported mode.proto file syntax = \"proto3\"; package sample; option java_package = \"io.api.sample\"; option java_multiple_files = true; import \"sample/mode.proto\"; message TableInfo { int32 winIndex = 1; Mode mode = 2; int32 min = 3; int32 max = 4; string id = 5; string dataAdapter = 6; string schema = 7; string selector = 8; string subscription_id = 9; } mode.proto file syntax = \"proto3\"; package sample; option java_package = \"io.api.sample\"; option java_multiple_files = true; enum Mode { MODE_UNKNOWN = 0; RAW = 1; MERGE = 2; DISTINCT = 3; COMMAND = 4; } In this example, two Protobuf artifacts are stored in Apicurio Registry, one for TableInfo and one for Mode. However, because Mode is part of TableInfo, whenever TableInfo is fetched to check a message in the SerDes, Mode is also returned as an artifact referenced by TableInfo.

For details on how to use Keycloak in a production environment, see the Keycloak documentation. This section explains how to manually configure authentication and authorization options for Apicurio Registry and Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The Apicurio Registry web console and core REST API support authentication in Azure AD based on OpenID Connect (OIDC) and the OAuth Authorization Code Flow. Apicurio Registry provides role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles. Apicurio Registry authentication and authorization settings are disabled by default. To secure Apicurio Registry with Azure AD, you require a valid directory in Azure AD with specific configuration. This involves registering the Apicurio Registry application in the Azure AD portal with recommended settings and configuring environment variables in Apicurio Registry. Prerequisites Azure AD is installed and running. For more details, see the Microsoft Azure AD user documentation. Apicurio Registry is installed and running. Procedure Log in to the Azure AD portal using your email address or GitHub account. In the navigation menu, select Manage > App registrations > New registration, and complete the following settings: Name: Enter your application name. For example: apicurio-registry-example Supported account types: Click Accounts in any organizational directory. Redirect URI: Select Single-page application from the list, and enter your Apicurio Registry web console application host. For example: https://test-registry.com/ui/ You must register your Apicurio Registry application host as a Redirect URI. When logging in, users are redirected from Apicurio Registry to Azure AD for authentication, and you want to send them back to your application afterwards. Azure AD does not allow any redirect URLs that are not registered. Click Register. You can view your app registration details by selecting Manage > App registrations > apicurio-registry-example. Select Manage > Authentication and ensure that the application is configured with your redirect URLs and tokens as follows: Redirect URIs: For example: https://test-registry.com/ui/ Implicit grant and hybrid flows: Click ID tokens (used for implicit and hybrid flows) Select Azure AD > Admin > App registrations > Your app > Application (client) ID. For example: 123456a7-b8c9-012d-e3f4-5fg67h8i901 Select Azure AD > Admin > App registrations > Your app > Directory (tenant) ID. For example: https://login.microsoftonline.com/1a2bc34d-567e-89f1-g0hi-1j2kl3m4no56/v2.0 In Apicurio Registry, configure the following environment variables with your Azure AD settings: Table 5.

The default roles expected by Apicurio Registry are sr-admin, sr-developer, and sr-readonly. In Apicurio Registry UI, configure the following environment variables: Environment variable Description Setting REGISTRY_AUTH_TYPE oidc REGISTRY_AUTH_TOKEN_TYPE Which token to use. Azure AD has non-standard access tokens, so we need to use id tokens. id Additional resources For details on configuring non-default user role names, see Apicurio Registry authentication and authorization configuration options. For more details on using Azure AD, see the Microsoft Azure AD user documentation. Apicurio Registry provides authentication options for OpenID Connect with Keycloak and HTTP basic authentication. Apicurio Registry provides authorization options for role-based and content-based approaches: Role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles. Content-based authorization for schema or API artifacts, where only the owner of the artifacts or artifact group can update or delete artifacts. All authentication and authorization options in Apicurio Registry are disabled by default. Before enabling any of these options, you must first set the QUARKUS_OIDC_TENANT_ENABLED option to true. This chapter provides details on the following configuration options: Apicurio Registry authentication by using OpenID Connect with Keycloak Apicurio Registry authentication by using HTTP basic Apicurio Registry role-based authorization Apicurio Registry owner-only authorization Apicurio Registry authenticated read access Apicurio Registry anonymous read-only access You can set the following environment variables to configure authentication for the Apicurio Registry web console and API with Keycloak: Table 7. Configuration for Apicurio Registry authentication with Keycloak Environment variable Description Type Default QUARKUS_OIDC_TENANT_ENABLED Enables authentication for Apicurio Registry. When set to true, the environment variables that follow are required for authentication using Keycloak. String false QUARKUS_OIDC_AUTH_SERVER_URL The URL of the Keycloak authentication server. For example, http://localhost:8080. String - QUARKUS_OIDC_CLIENT_ID The client ID for the Apicurio Registry REST API. String registry-api APICURIO_UI_AUTH_OIDC_CLIENT_ID The client ID for the Apicurio Registry web console. String apicurio-registry QUARKUS_OIDC_TLS_TRUST_STORE_FILE Specifies the file path to the TLS trust store used by Quarkus for securing OpenID Connect (OIDC) communications. The trust store can be populated with the trusted certificates needed to establish secure TLS connections with the OIDC provider. String - QUARKUS_OIDC_TLS_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD The password required to access the TLS trust store file. String - APICURIO_AUTH_ROLE_BASED_AUTHORIZATION Enables or disables role-based authorization. Boolean False By default, Apicurio Registry supports authentication by using OpenID Connect. Users or API clients must obtain an access token to make authenticated calls to the Apicurio Registry REST API. However, because some tools do not support OpenID Connect, you can also configure Apicurio Registry to support HTTP basic authentication by setting the following configuration options to true: Table 8. Configuration for Apicurio Registry HTTP basic authentication Environment variable Java system property Type Default value QUARKUS_OIDC_TENANT_ENABLED quarkus.oidc.tenant-enabled Boolean false APICURIO_AUTHN_BASIC_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_ENABLED apicurio.authn.basic-client-credentials.enabled Boolean false You can also configure the HTTP basic client credentials cache expiry time. By default, when using HTTP basic authentication, Apicurio Registry caches JWT tokens, and does not issue a new token when there is no need. You can configure the cache expiry time for JWT tokens, which is set to 10 mins by default. When using Keycloak, it is best to set this configuration to your Keycloak JWT expiry time minus one minute. For example, if you have the expiry time set to 5 mins in Keycloak, you should set the following configuration option to 4 mins: Table 9. Configuration for HTTP basic client credentials cache expiry Environment variable Java system property Type Default value APICURIO_AUTHN_BASIC_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_CACHE_EXPIRATION apicurio.authn.basic-client-credentials.cache-expiration Integer 10 You can set the following options to true to enable role-based authorization in Apicurio Registry: Table 10. Configuration for Apicurio Registry role-based authorization Environment variable Java system property Type Default value QUARKUS_OIDC_TENANT_ENABLED quarkus.oidc.tenant-enabled Boolean false APICURIO_AUTH_ROLE_BASED_AUTHORIZATION apicurio.auth.role-based-authorization Boolean false You can then configure role-based authorization to use roles included in the user’s authentication token (for example, granted when authenticating by using Keycloak), or to use role mappings managed internally by Apicurio Registry. To enable using roles assigned by Keycloak, set the following environment variables: Table 11. Configuration for Apicurio Registry role-based authorization by using Keycloak Environment variable Description Type Default APICURIO_AUTH_ROLE_SOURCE When set to token, user roles are taken from the authentication token. String token APICURIO_AUTH_ROLES_ADMIN The name of the role that indicates a user is an admin. String sr-admin APICURIO_AUTH_ROLES_DEVELOPER The name of the role that indicates a user is a developer. String sr-developer APICURIO_AUTH_ROLES_READONLY The name of the role that indicates a user has read-only access. String sr-readonly When Apicurio Registry is configured to use roles from Keycloak, you must assign Apicurio Registry users to at least one of the following user roles in Keycloak. However, you can configure different user role names by using the environment variables in Configuration for Apicurio Registry role-based authorization by using Keycloak. Table 12. Apicurio Registry roles for authentication and authorization Role name Read artifacts Write artifacts Global rules Description sr-admin Yes Yes Yes Full access to all create, read, update, and delete operations. sr-developer Yes Yes No Access to create, read, update, and delete operations, except configuring global rules and import/export. This role can configure artifact-specific rules only. sr-readonly Yes No No Access to read and search operations only. This role cannot configure any rules. To enable using roles managed internally by Apicurio Registry, set the following environment variable: Table 13. Configuration for Apicurio Registry role-based authorization by using internal role mappings Environment variable Description Type Default APICURIO_AUTH_ROLE_SOURCE When set to application, user roles are managed internally by Apicurio Registry. String token When using internally managed role mappings, users can be assigned a role by using the /admin/roleMappings endpoint in the Apicurio Registry REST API. For more details, see Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. Users can be granted exactly one role: ADMIN, DEVELOPER, or READ_ONLY. Only users with admin privileges can grant access to other users. Because there are no default admin users in Apicurio Registry, it is usually helpful to configure another way for users to be identified as admins. You can configure this admin-override feature by using the following environment variables: Table 14. Configuration for Apicurio Registry admin-override Environment variable Description Type Default APICURIO_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_ENABLED Enables the admin-override feature. String false APICURIO_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_FROM Where to look for admin-override information. Only token is currently supported. String token APICURIO_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_TYPE The type of information used to determine if a user is an admin. Values depend on the value of the FROM variable, for example, role or claim when FROM is token. String role APICURIO_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_ROLE The name of the role that indicates a user is an admin. String sr-admin APICURIO_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_CLAIM The name of a JWT token claim to use for determining admin-override. String org-admin APICURIO_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_CLAIM_VALUE The value that the JWT token claim indicated by the CLAIM variable must be for the user to be granted admin-override. String true For example, you can use this admin-override feature to assign the sr-admin role to a single user in Keycloak, which grants that user the admin role. That user can then use the /admin/roleMappings REST API (or associated UI) to grant roles to additional users (including additional admins). You can set the following options to true to enable owner-only authorization for updates to artifacts or artifact groups in Apicurio Registry: Table 15. Configuration for owner-only authorization Environment variable Java system property Type Default value QUARKUS_OIDC_TENANT_ENABLED quarkus.oidc.tenant-enabled Boolean false APICURIO_AUTH_OWNER_ONLY_AUTHORIZATION apicurio.auth.owner-only-authorization Boolean false APICURIO_AUTH_OWNER_ONLY_AUTHORIZATION_LIMIT_GROUP_ACCESS apicurio.auth.owner-only-authorization.limit-group-access Boolean false When owner-only authorization is enabled, only the user who created an artifact can modify or delete that artifact. When owner-only authorization and group owner-only authorization are both enabled, only the user who created an artifact group has write access to that artifact group, for example, to add or remove artifacts in that group. When the authenticated read access option is enabled, Apicurio Registry grants at least read-only access to requests from any authenticated user in the same organization, regardless of their user role. To enable authenticated read access, you must first enable role-based authorization, and then ensure that the following options are set to true: Table 16. Configuration for authenticated read access Environment variable Java system property Type Default value QUARKUS_OIDC_TENANT_ENABLED quarkus.oidc.tenant-enabled Boolean false APICURIO_AUTH_AUTHENTICATED_READ_ACCESS_ENABLED apicurio.auth.authenticated-read-access.enabled Boolean false For more details, see Apicurio Registry role-based authorization. In addition to the two main types of authorization (role-based and owner-based authorization), Apicurio Registry supports an anonymous read-only access option. To allow anonymous users, such as REST API calls with no authentication credentials, to make read-only calls to the REST API, set the following options to true: Table 17. Configuration for anonymous read-only access Environment variable Java system property Type Default value QUARKUS_OIDC_TENANT_ENABLED quarkus.oidc.tenant-enabled Boolean false APICURIO_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_READ_ACCESS_ENABLED apicurio.auth.anonymous-read-access.enabled Boolean false Additional resources For an example of how to set environment variables in your Apicurio Registry deployment on OpenShift, see [configuring-liveness-readiness-probes_registry] For details on configuring custom authentication for Apicurio Registry, the see Quarkus Open ID Connect documentation Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a browser security feature that controls how web applications running at one origin can request resources from a different origin. Apicurio Registry includes built-in CORS support that you can configure to allow the Apicurio Registry web console or other client applications to access the Apicurio Registry REST API from different domains. CORS configuration in Apicurio Registry is based on the underlying Quarkus HTTP CORS filter. By default, Apicurio Registry enables CORS and allows requests from http://localhost:8888 and http://127.0.0.1:8888 for local development. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running. Procedure Configure the following environment variables to customize CORS behavior for your Apicurio Registry deployment: Table 18. Configuration for Apicurio Registry CORS Environment variable Description Default QUARKUS_HTTP_CORS Enables or disables the CORS filter. Set to true to enable CORS support. true QUARKUS_HTTP_CORS_ORIGINS A comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS requests. Use * to allow all origins, or specify explicit origins such as https://my-ui.example.com. For multiple origins, use a comma-separated list, for example: https://ui1.example.com,\\https://ui2.example.com. http://localhost:8888,http://127.0.0.1:8888 QUARKUS_HTTP_CORS_METHODS A comma-separated list of HTTP methods allowed for CORS requests. GET,PUT,POST,PATCH,DELETE,OPTIONS QUARKUS_HTTP_CORS_HEADERS A comma-separated list of HTTP headers allowed in CORS requests. This includes custom Apicurio Registry headers used for artifact metadata. See note below The default allowed headers include: x-registry-name, x-registry-name-encoded, x-registry-description, x-registry-description-encoded, x-registry-version, x-registry-artifactid, x-registry-artifacttype, x-registry-hash-algorithm, x-registry-content-hash, access-control-request-method, access-control-allow-credentials, access-control-allow-origin, access-control-allow-headers, authorization, content-type, content-encoding, user-agent. Example: Allow all origins (development only) environment: QUARKUS_HTTP_CORS_ORIGINS: \"*\" Using * to allow all origins is not recommended for production deployments. Always specify explicit allowed origins in production environments.

This includes features such as the Apicurio Registry web console, logging, health checks, and observability: Configuring the Apicurio Registry web console Configuring Apicurio Registry observability with OpenTelemetry Configuring Apicurio Registry health checks on OpenShift Environment variables for Apicurio Registry health checks For a list of all available configuration options, see Apicurio Registry configuration reference. You can set optional environment variables to configure the Apicurio Registry web console specifically for your deployment environment or to customize its behavior. Prerequisites You have already installed Apicurio Registry. When you access the Apicurio Registry web console in your browser, some initial configuration settings are loaded. The following configuration settings are required: URL for core Apicurio Registry server REST API v3 Typically the Apicurio Registry Operator will automatically configure the UI component with the REST API v3 URL. However, you can override this value by configuring the appropriate environment variable in the UI component deployment configuration. Procedure Configure the following environment variables to override the default URL: REGISTRY_API_URL: Specifies the URL for the core Apicurio Registry server REST API v3. For example, https://registry-api.my-domain.com/apis/registry/v3 You can configure the Apicurio Registry web console in read-only mode as an optional feature. This mode disables all features in the Apicurio Registry web console that allow users to make changes to registered artifacts. For example, this includes the following: Creating a group Creating an artifact Uploading a new artifact version Updating artifact metadata Deleting an artifact Procedure Configure the following environment variable: REGISTRY_FEATURE_READ_ONLY: Set to true to enable read-only mode. Defaults to false. You can configure Apicurio Registry to export telemetry data using OpenTelemetry (OTel) for comprehensive observability. This includes distributed tracing, metrics export via OTLP protocol, and log correlation with trace context. Apicurio Registry is built with OpenTelemetry support and all telemetry signals (traces, metrics, logs) are enabled at build time. However, the OpenTelemetry SDK is disabled by default at runtime. When enabled, Apicurio Registry exports telemetry data to an OpenTelemetry-compatible collector such as Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, or the OpenTelemetry Collector. The individual signal properties (QUARKUS_OTEL_TRACES_ENABLED, QUARKUS_OTEL_METRICS_ENABLED, QUARKUS_OTEL_LOGS_ENABLED) are build-time properties and cannot be changed at runtime. All signals are already enabled in the Apicurio Registry build. Use QUARKUS_OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=false to enable telemetry at runtime. Prerequisites You have already installed Apicurio Registry. You have an OpenTelemetry-compatible backend available (for example, Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, or OpenTelemetry Collector). To enable OpenTelemetry observability, configure the following environment variables: Table 1. Environment variables for enabling OpenTelemetry Environment Variable Description QUARKUS_OTEL_SDK_DISABLED Set to false to enable the OpenTelemetry SDK and all telemetry signals. Default is true (disabled). QUARKUS_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT The endpoint URL of your OpenTelemetry collector. For example, http://jaeger:4317 for gRPC or http://jaeger:4318 for HTTP. Example: Enabling OpenTelemetry with Jaeger environment: QUARKUS_OTEL_SDK_DISABLED: \"false\" QUARKUS_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: \"http://jaeger:4317\" In production environments, you should configure trace sampling to reduce overhead and control the volume of trace data: Table 2. Environment variables for trace sampling Environment Variable Description QUARKUS_OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER The sampling strategy. Use parentbased_traceidratio for production. QUARKUS_OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG The sampling ratio (0.0 to 1.0). A value of 0.1 samples 10% of traces. Example: Production sampling configuration (10% of traces) environment: QUARKUS_OTEL_SDK_DISABLED: \"false\" QUARKUS_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: \"http://otel-collector:4317\" QUARKUS_OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER: \"parentbased_traceidratio\" QUARKUS_OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG: \"0.1\" When using JSON logging format, Apicurio Registry automatically includes trace context (trace ID and span ID) in log entries. This enables correlation between logs and traces. Example: Enabling structured logging with trace context environment: QUARKUS_OTEL_TRACES_ENABLED: \"true\" QUARKUS_LOG_CONSOLE_JSON: \"true\" When OpenTelemetry is enabled, Apicurio Registry provides the following observability features: Distributed tracing: All REST API requests are automatically traced with spans containing request details, path parameters, and Apicurio-specific attributes such as groupId, artifactId, and version. Storage layer tracing: All storage operations create child spans, enabling you to trace the complete request flow from REST API to database. Kafka tracing: When using KafkaSQL storage, Kafka operations are automatically traced with context propagation. Custom metrics: OpenTelemetry metrics for artifact operations, schema validations, and search requests are exported alongside existing Prometheus metrics. Log correlation: When JSON logging is enabled, trace context is automatically injected into log entries for easy correlation. OpenTelemetry instrumentation adds a small performance overhead. The following table shows the measured impact when all telemetry signals are enabled with 100% sampling: Table 3. Performance impact with OpenTelemetry enabled (100% sampling) Operation Latency Increase Throughput Decrease Impact Level System Info +9% (+0.35ms) -7% Low Create Artifact +4% (+0.13ms) -1% Minimal Get Artifact +5% (+0.05ms) -6% Minimal Search Artifacts +1% (+0.04ms) -1% Minimal List Groups +6% (+0.16ms) -5% Low Key findings: Average overhead is approximately 4-6% in throughput with 100% trace sampling. With the recommended 10% sampling ratio (QUARKUS_OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG=0.1), the overhead is reduced to less than 1%. OpenTelemetry signals are disabled by default to avoid any overhead for users who do not require observability features. To reproduce these benchmarks, run the following commands from the project root: # Build the project ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests # Run benchmark with OTEL disabled (baseline) ./mvnw test -pl app -Dtest=OpenTelemetryPerformanceTest \\ -DOpenTelemetryPerformanceTest=enabled # Run benchmark with OTEL enabled ./mvnw test -pl app -Dtest=OpenTelemetryPerformanceEnabledTest \\ -DOpenTelemetryPerformanceTest=enabled OpenTelemetry support is fully backwards compatible: The existing Prometheus metrics endpoint (/q/metrics) remains available and unchanged. Health check endpoints (/q/health/*) continue to work as before. All existing Micrometer-based metrics continue to function. Additional resources OpenTelemetry Documentation Quarkus OpenTelemetry Guide Jaeger Documentation You can configure optional environment variables for liveness and readiness probes to monitor the health of the Apicurio Registry server on OpenShift: Liveness probes test if the application can make progress. If the application cannot make progress, OpenShift automatically restarts the failing Pod. Readiness probes test if the application is ready to process requests. If the application is not ready, it can become overwhelmed by requests, and OpenShift stops sending requests for the time that the probe fails. If other Pods are OK, they continue to receive requests. The default values of the liveness and readiness environment variables are designed for most cases and should only be changed if required by your environment. Any changes to the defaults depend on your hardware, network, and amount of data stored. These values should be kept as low as possible to avoid unnecessary overhead. Prerequisites You must have an OpenShift cluster with cluster administrator access. You must have already installed Apicurio Registry on OpenShift. You must have already installed and configured your chosen Apicurio Registry storage in either Strimzi or PostgreSQL. Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Click Installed Operators > Apicurio Registry. On the ApicurioRegistry tab, click the Operator custom resource for your deployment, for example, example-apicurioregistry. In the main overview page, find the Deployment Name section and the corresponding DeploymentConfig name for your Apicurio Registry deployment, for example, example-apicurioregistry. In the left navigation menu, click Workloads > Deployment Configs, and select your DeploymentConfig name. Click the Environment tab, and enter your environment variables in the Single values env section, for example: NAME: LIVENESS_STATUS_RESET VALUE: 350 Click Save at the bottom. Alternatively, you can perform these steps using the OpenShift oc command. For more details, see the OpenShift CLI documentation. Additional resources Environment variables for Apicurio Registry health checks OpenShift documentation on monitoring application health This section describes the available environment variables for Apicurio Registry health checks on OpenShift. These include liveness and readiness probes to monitor the health of the Apicurio Registry server on OpenShift. For an example procedure, see Configuring Apicurio Registry health checks on OpenShift. The following environment variables are provided for reference only. The default values are designed for most cases and should only be changed if required by your environment. Any changes to the defaults depend on your hardware, network, and amount of data stored. These values should be kept as low as possible to avoid unnecessary overhead. Table 4. Environment variables for Apicurio Registry liveness probes Name Description Type Default LIVENESS_ERROR_THRESHOLD Number of liveness issues or errors that can occur before the liveness probe fails. Integer 1 LIVENESS_COUNTER_RESET Period in which the threshold number of errors must occur. For example, if this value is 60 and the threshold is 1, the check fails after two errors occur in 1 minute Seconds 60 LIVENESS_STATUS_RESET Number of seconds that must elapse without any more errors for the liveness probe to reset to OK status. Seconds 300 LIVENESS_ERRORS_IGNORED Comma-separated list of ignored liveness exceptions. String io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException,org.apache.kafka.streams.errors.InvalidStateStoreException Because OpenShift automatically restarts a Pod that fails a liveness check, the liveness settings, unlike readiness settings, do not directly affect behavior of Apicurio Registry on OpenShift. Table 5. Environment variables for Apicurio Registry readiness probes Name Description Type Default READINESS_ERROR_THRESHOLD Number of readiness issues or errors that can occur before the readiness probe fails. Integer 1 READINESS_COUNTER_RESET Period in which the threshold number of errors must occur. For example, if this value is 60 and the threshold is 1, the check fails after two errors occur in 1 minute. Seconds 60 READINESS_STATUS_RESET Number of seconds that must elapse without any more errors for the liveness probe to reset to OK status. In this case, this means how long the Pod stays not ready, until it returns to normal operation. Seconds 300 READINESS_TIMEOUT Readiness tracks the timeout of two operations: How long it takes for storage requests to complete How long it takes for HTTP REST API requests to return a response If these operations take more time than the configured timeout, this is counted as a readiness issue or error. This value controls the timeouts for both operations.

You use the ApicurioRegistry3 CR to deploy and manage Apicurio Registry instances on Kubernetes. The custom resource allows you to declaratively configure all aspects of your Apicurio Registry deployment, including storage, authentication, networking, and component-specific settings. Additional ApicurioRegistry3 custom resource examples can be found in the Apicurio Registry upstream repository. The ApicurioRegistry3 custom resource is organized into two main components: spec.app - Configures the Apicurio Registry backend (REST API) component spec.ui - Configures the Apicurio Registry web console component Each component can be independently configured with its own settings for replicas, ingress, environment variables, and pod specifications. Apicurio Registry supports three storage options: In-memory (default) - Stores data in memory. Suitable for development and testing only. Data is lost when the pod restarts. PostgreSQL - Stores data in a PostgreSQL database. Suitable for production deployments. MySQL - Stores data in a MySQL database. Suitable for production deployments. KafkaSQL - Stores data in Apache Kafka topics with an in-memory cache. Suitable for production deployments when configured with persistent Kafka storage. The default in-memory storage is not suitable for production environments. This section shows how to deploy a basic Apicurio Registry instance using in-memory storage. This configuration is suitable for development and testing environments only. Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to an Kubernetes cluster. You must have already installed the Apicurio Registry Operator. See Installing Apicurio Registry on OpenShift. Procedure In the Kubernetes web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Change to the namespace in which the Apicurio Registry Operator is installed. For example, from the Project drop-down, select my-project. Click Installed Operators > Apicurio Registry > ApicurioRegistry3 > Create ApicurioRegistry3. Paste in the following custom resource definition: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry3 metadata: name: example-registry spec: app: ingress: host: registry.example.com ui: ingress: host: registry-ui.example.com Replace the host values with appropriate hostnames for your environment. Currently, Apicurio Registry Operator only creates simple HTTP Ingresses. To enable TLS, you must create your own Ingress or Route resources with TLS configuration. Click Create and wait for the Apicurio Registry deployment to be created. Click Networking > Ingresses (or Routes) to access the route for the Apicurio Registry web console. Verification Access the Apicurio Registry web console using the configured hostname and verify that the UI loads successfully. This section explains how to deploy Apicurio Registry with PostgreSQL database storage. This configuration is suitable for production environments. Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to an Kubernetes cluster. You must have already installed the Apicurio Registry Operator. See Installing Apicurio Registry on OpenShift. You must have a PostgreSQL database available with a database created for Apicurio Registry. You must have created a Kubernetes Secret containing the PostgreSQL database password. Procedure Create a Secret containing the database password: apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: postgresql-credentials type: Opaque stringData: password: your-database-password In the Kubernetes web console, click Installed Operators > Apicurio Registry > ApicurioRegistry3 > Create ApicurioRegistry3.

Verification Access the Apicurio Registry web console and create a test artifact to verify that data is being persisted to the database. Restart the Apicurio Registry pod and verify that the artifact still exists, confirming that data is persisted. This section explains how to deploy Apicurio Registry with KafkaSQL storage. KafkaSQL uses Apache Kafka as the primary data store with an in-memory H2 database for caching. This configuration is suitable for production environments when using persistent Kafka storage. Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to an Kubernetes cluster. You must have already installed the Apicurio Registry Operator. See Installing Apicurio Registry on OpenShift. You must have a Kafka cluster available. For OpenShift, see Installing Apicurio Registry storage on OpenShift. Procedure Obtain the Kafka bootstrap servers address from your Kafka cluster. For example, with Strimzi: my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.my-project.svc:9092 In the Kubernetes web console, click Installed Operators > Apicurio Registry > ApicurioRegistry3 > Create ApicurioRegistry3. Paste in the following custom resource definition, adjusting the bootstrapServers value: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry3 metadata: name: example-registry-kafkasql spec: app: storage: type: kafkasql kafkasql: bootstrapServers: my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.my-project.svc:9092 ingress: host: registry.example.com ui: ingress: host: registry-ui.example.com Click Create and wait for the Apicurio Registry deployment to be created. If using Strimzi, configure the Kafka topic that Apicurio Registry uses (named kafkasql-journal by default) with delete cleanup policy and infinite retention: apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2 kind: KafkaTopic metadata: name: kafkasql-journal labels: strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster spec: partitions: 3 replicas: 3 config: cleanup.policy: delete retention.ms: -1 retention.bytes: -1 You must configure the Kafka topic used by Apicurio Registry with cleanup.policy: delete and infinite retention (retention.ms: -1 and retention.bytes: -1), otherwise data loss might occur. Verification Access the Apicurio Registry web console and create a test artifact to verify that data is being persisted to Kafka. Restart the Apicurio Registry pod and verify that the artifact still exists after the cache is rebuilt from Kafka. When your Kafka cluster requires TLS encryption, you can configure Apicurio Registry to connect securely: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry3 metadata: name: example-registry-kafkasql-tls spec: app: storage: type: kafkasql kafkasql: bootstrapServers: my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.my-project.svc:9093 tls: truststoreSecretRef: name: kafka-cluster-ca-cert key: ca.p12 truststorePasswordSecretRef: name: kafka-cluster-ca-cert key: ca.password ingress: host: registry.example.com The Secret containing the Kafka cluster CA certificate must be in PKCS12 format. When your Kafka cluster requires SASL authentication (such as SCRAM-SHA-512), you can configure Apicurio Registry accordingly: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry3 metadata: name: example-registry-kafkasql-sasl spec: app: storage: type: kafkasql kafkasql: bootstrapServers: my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.my-project.svc:9093 auth: mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512 usernameSecretRef: name: kafka-credentials key: username passwordSecretRef: name: kafka-credentials key: password ingress: host: registry.example.com Additional resources For more information on Kafka storage configuration, see Configuring Apicurio Registry with Kafka storage on OpenShift in Installing Apicurio Registry storage on OpenShift. This section explains how to configure Apicurio Registry with OIDC authentication and role-based authorization using an identity provider such as Keycloak. Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to an Kubernetes cluster. You must have already deployed Apicurio Registry. See Deploying Apicurio Registry with in-memory storage. You must have an OIDC identity provider configured with appropriate clients for Apicurio Registry. Procedure Configure two clients in your identity provider: Backend API client (e.g., registry-client-api) - Used by the Apicurio Registry backend (REST API) component. UI client (e.g., registry-client-ui) - Used by the Apicurio Registry web console component. Update your ApicurioRegistry3 custom resource to enable authentication: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry3 metadata: name: example-registry spec: app: auth: enabled: true appClientId: registry-client-api uiClientId: registry-client-ui authServerUrl: https://keycloak.example.com/realms/registry redirectUri: https://registry-ui.example.com logoutUrl: https://registry-ui.example.com ingress: host: registry.example.com ui: ingress: host: registry-ui.example.com To enable role-based authorization, add the authz configuration: spec: app: auth: enabled: true appClientId: registry-client-api uiClientId: registry-client-ui authServerUrl: https://keycloak.example.com/realms/registry redirectUri: https://registry-ui.example.com logoutUrl: https://registry-ui.example.com authz: enabled: true ownerOnlyEnabled: true roles: source: token admin: sr-admin developer: sr-developer readOnly: sr-readonly ingress: host: registry.example.com To enable admin override functionality: spec: app: auth: authz: enabled: true ownerOnlyEnabled: true adminOverride: enabled: true from: token type: role role: sr-admin To allow anonymous read-only access: spec: app: auth: enabled: true anonymousReadsEnabled: true appClientId: registry-client-api # ... other auth settings Verification Access the Apicurio Registry web console and verify that you are redirected to the identity provider login page. Log in with different users having different roles and verify that authorization is enforced correctly. To enable HTTP basic authentication for client credentials flow (useful for service accounts): spec: app: auth: enabled: true appClientId: registry-client-api authServerUrl: https://keycloak.example.com/realms/registry basicAuth: enabled: true cacheExpiration: 25m When your identity provider uses custom certificates, configure TLS verification: spec: app: auth: enabled: true appClientId: registry-client-api authServerUrl: https://keycloak.example.com/realms/registry tls: tlsVerificationType: all truststoreSecretRef: name: keycloak-ca-cert key: ca.p12 truststorePasswordSecretRef: name: keycloak-ca-cert key: ca.password Set tlsVerificationType to none to disable TLS verification (not recommended for production). Additional resources For more information on Apicurio Registry security configuration, see Apicurio Registry security in Configuring Apicurio Registry security options. This section explains how to configure Ingress resources and networking for Apicurio Registry components. You can specify the Ingress hostname and IngressClass for each component: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry3 metadata: name: example-registry spec: app: ingress: host: registry-api.example.com ingressClassName: nginx annotations: nginx.org/proxy-connect-timeout: \"30s\" ui: ingress: host: registry-ui.example.com ingressClassName: nginx annotations: nginx.org/proxy-connect-timeout: \"30s\" If you want to manage Ingress resources manually: spec: app: ingress: enabled: false ui: ingress: enabled: false When Ingress is disabled, you must create your own Ingress or Route resources to expose the Apicurio Registry services. The operator creates NetworkPolicy resources by default. To manage NetworkPolicy manually: spec: app: networkPolicy: enabled: false ui: networkPolicy: enabled: false This section explains how to enable optional features in Apicurio Registry. By default, artifacts and groups in Apicurio Registry are immutable and cannot be deleted. To enable deletion: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry3 metadata: name: example-registry spec: app: features: resourceDeleteEnabled: true By default, artifact versions are immutable once created. To allow draft versions to be mutable: spec: app: features: versionMutabilityEnabled: true Enabling version mutability also unlocks Studio functionality in the Apicurio Registry UI. This section explains how to configure the Apicurio Registry web console component. If you only need the REST API and don’t want to deploy the UI: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry3 metadata: name: example-registry spec: app: ingress: host: registry.example.com ui: enabled: false You can configure the UI with environment variables: spec: ui: env: - name: REGISTRY_API_URL value: https://registry.example.com/apis/registry/v3 ingress: host: registry-ui.example.com This section covers advanced configuration options for Apicurio Registry. You can configure the number of replicas for each component: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry3 metadata: name: example-registry spec: app: replicas: 3 ingress: host: registry.example.com ui: replicas: 2 ingress: host: registry-ui.example.com The operator creates PodDisruptionBudget resources by default. To manage PodDisruptionBudget manually: spec: app: podDisruptionBudget: enabled: false ui: podDisruptionBudget: enabled: false You can add custom environment variables to Apicurio Registry components: spec: app: env: - name: QUARKUS_LOG_LEVEL value: DEBUG - name: CUSTOM_CONFIG valueFrom: configMapKeyRef: name: my-config key: custom.value Order of evaluation: The environment variables defined in the env field override any environment variables set by the operator. This allows you to customize configuration and provide workarounds in case of bugs while still benefiting from operator-managed settings. You should not use the custom PodTemplateSpec method described below to set environment variables. For advanced pod configuration, you can provide a custom PodTemplateSpec: spec: app: podTemplateSpec: metadata: labels: custom-label: custom-value annotations: custom-annotation: custom-value spec: containers: - name: apicurio-registry-app resources: requests: memory: \"512Mi\" cpu: \"500m\" limits: memory: \"1Gi\" cpu: \"1000m\" affinity: podAntiAffinity: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - weight: 100 podAffinityTerm: labelSelector: matchExpressions: - key: app operator: In values: - apicurio-registry topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname To customize the component container (for example, to set resource requests/limits), you must specify the container name as follows: apicurio-registry-app for the Apicurio Registry backend (REST API) component. apicurio-registry-ui for the Apicurio Registry web console component. However, you can also add additional containers to the pod if needed. Order of evaluation: The operator first extends the provided PodTemplateSpec with default values and then applies additional configuration based on other fields in the ApicurioRegistry3 CR.

All configured global rules, group-specific rules, or artifact-specific rules must pass before a new artifact version can be added to Apicurio Registry. Configured artifact-specific rules override any configured group-specific rules, which in turn override any configured global rules. The goal of these rules is to prevent invalid content from being added to Apicurio Registry and to control the evolution of an artifact (by e.g. checking the compatibility of a new artifact version against previous versions). For example, content can be invalid for the following reasons: Invalid syntax for a given artifact type, for example, AVRO or PROTOBUF. Valid syntax, but semantics violate a specification. Incompatibility, when new content includes breaking changes relative to the current artifact version. Artifact reference integrity, for example, a duplicate or non-existent artifact reference mapping. You can enable optional content rules using the Apicurio Registry web console, REST API commands, or by using one of the SDKs. Rules are applied only when content is added to Apicurio Registry. This includes the following REST operations: Adding an artifact Adding an artifact version If a rule is violated, Apicurio Registry returns an HTTP error. The response body includes the violated rule and a message showing what went wrong. The order of precedence for artifact-specific and global rules is as follows: Artifact-specific rules have the highest priority Group-specific rules have the next highest priority Global rules have the lowest priority If a rule is configured at a higher level (e.g. at the global level), but you want that rule to be disabled at a lower level, you must configure the same rule (so that it overrides it) at the lower level and set its rules value to NONE. Each rule has a name and configuration information. Apicurio Registry maintains the list of rules for each artifact, each group, and the list of global rules. Each rule in the list consists of a name and configuration for the rule implementation. When a rule is executed, it is provided with the content of the current version of the artifact (if one exists) and the new version of the artifact being added. The rule implementation returns either passes or fails depending on whether the artifact passes the rule. If not, Apicurio Registry reports the reason why in an HTTP error response. Some rules might not use the previous version of the content. For example, compatibility rules use previous versions, but syntax or semantic validity rules do not. Additional resources For more details, see Apicurio Registry rule reference. Administrators can configure Apicurio Registry global rules, group-specific rules, and artifact-specific rules. Developers can configure group-specific and artifact-specific rules only. Apicurio Registry applies the rules configured for the specific artifact. If no rules are configured at that level, Apicurio Registry applies the group-specific rules. If no rules are configured at the group level, then Apicurio Registry applies the globally configured rules. If no global rules are configured, then no rules are applied. You can configure group-specific and artifact-specific rules using the Apicurio Registry web console or REST API. For details, see the following: Managing Apicurio Registry content using the web console Apicurio Registry REST API documentation Administrators can configure global rules in several ways: Use the admin/rules operations in the REST API Use the Apicurio Registry web console Set default global rules using Apicurio Registry application properties Configure default global rules Administrators can configure Apicurio Registry at the application level to enable or disable global rules.

You can use Apicurio Registry to decouple the structure of your data from your client applications, and to share and manage your data types and API descriptions at runtime using a REST interface. Client applications can dynamically push or pull the latest schema updates to or from Apicurio Registry at runtime without needing to redeploy. Developer teams can query Apicurio Registry for existing schemas required for services already deployed in production, and can register new schemas required for new services in development. You can enable client applications to use schemas and API designs stored in Apicurio Registry by specifying the Apicurio Registry URL in your client application code. Apicurio Registry can store schemas used to serialize and deserialize messages, which are referenced from your client applications to ensure that the messages that they send and receive are compatible with those schemas. Using Apicurio Registry to decouple your data structure from your applications reduces costs by decreasing overall message size, and creates efficiencies by increasing consistent reuse of schemas and API designs across your organization. Apicurio Registry provides a web console to make it easy for developers and administrators to manage registry content. You can configure optional rules to govern the evolution of your Apicurio Registry content. These include rules to ensure that uploaded content is valid, or is compatible with other versions. Any configured rules must pass before new versions can be uploaded to Apicurio Registry, which ensures that time is not wasted on invalid or incompatible schemas or API designs. Multiple payload formats for standard event schema and API specifications such as Apache Avro, JSON Schema, Google Protobuf, AsyncAPI, OpenAPI, and more. Pluggable Apicurio Registry storage options for storing content in Apache Kafka or PostgreSQL database. Rules for content validation, compatibility, and integrity to govern how Apicurio Registry content evolves over time. Apicurio Registry content management using web console, REST API, command line, Maven plug-in, or language SDKs. Full Apache Kafka schema registry support, including integration with Kafka Connect for external systems. Kafka client serializers/deserializers (SerDes) to validate message types at runtime. Compatibility with existing Confluent schema registry client applications. Cloud-native Quarkus Java runtime for low memory footprint and fast deployment times. Operator-based installation of Apicurio Registry on OpenShift/Kubernetes. OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication using Keycloak. The items stored in Apicurio Registry, such as event schemas and API designs, are known as registry artifacts. The following shows an example of an Apache Avro schema artifact in JSON format for a simple share price application: Example Avro schema { \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"price\", \"namespace\": \"com.example\", \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"symbol\", \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"name\": \"price\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } When a schema or API design is added as an artifact in Apicurio Registry, client applications can then use that schema or API design to validate that the client messages conform to the correct data structure at runtime. Artifacts have metadata, both generated and editable. Standard metadata for an artifact includes (but may not be limited to): groupId artifactId artifactType createdOn modifiedBy modifiedOn name description labels owner Every artifact is composed of zero or more _artifact version_s. Only artifact versions have actual content (as well as metadata). These versions represent the evolution of the content of an artifact, and are immutable. You can think of an Artifact as an ordered sequence of Versions, typically with the most recent version representing the \"current\" schema or API design content. Artifact Versions have metadata, both generated and editable. Standard metadata for an artifact version includes (but may not be limited to): groupId artifactId version globalId contentId owner createdOn modifiedBy modifiedOn name description labels state An artifact group is an optional named collection of schema or API artifacts. Each group contains a logically related set of schemas or API designs, typically managed by a single entity, belonging to a particular application or organization. You can create optional artifact groups when adding your schemas and API designs to organize them in Apicurio Registry. For example, you could create groups to match your development and production application environments, or your sales and engineering organizations. Schema and API groups can contain multiple artifact types. For example, you could have Protobuf, Avro, JSON Schema, OpenAPI, or AsyncAPI artifacts all in the same group. Groups have metadata, both generated and editable. Standard metadata for a group includes (but may not be limited to): groupId owner createdOn modifiedBy modifiedOn description labels You can create schema and API artifacts and groups using the Apicurio Registry web console, REST API, command line, Maven plug-in, or Java client application. Specifying a group is optional when using the Apicurio Registry web console, and the default group is used automatically. When using the REST API or Maven plug-in, specify the default group in the API path if you do not want to create a unique group. Additional resources For information on supported artifact types, see Apicurio Registry artifact reference. For information on the Core Registry API, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. Some Apicurio Registry artifact types can include artifact references from one artifact file to another. You can create efficiencies by defining reusable schema or API components, and then referencing them from multiple locations. For example, you can specify a reference in JSON Schema or OpenAPI using a $ref statement, or in Google Protobuf using an import statement, or in Apache Avro using a nested namespace. The following example shows a simple Avro schema named TradeKey that includes a reference to another schema named Exchange using a nested namespace: Tradekey schema with nested Exchange schema { \"namespace\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.trade\", \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"TradeKey\", \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"exchange\", \"type\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.common.Exchange\" }, { \"name\": \"key\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } Exchange schema { \"namespace\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.common\", \"type\": \"enum\", \"name\": \"Exchange\", \"symbols\" : [\"GEMINI\"] } An artifact reference is stored in Apicurio Registry as a collection of artifact metadata that maps from an artifact type-specific reference to an internal Apicurio Registry reference. Each artifact reference in Apicurio Registry is composed of the following: Group ID Artifact ID Artifact version Artifact reference name You can manage artifact references using the Apicurio Registry core REST API, Maven plug-in, and Java serializers/deserializers (SerDes). Apicurio Registry stores the artifact references along with the artifact content. Apicurio Registry also maintains a collection of all artifact references so you can search them or list all references for a specific artifact. Apicurio Registry currently supports artifact references for the following artifact types only: Avro Protobuf JSON Schema OpenAPI AsyncAPI Additional resources For details on managing artifact references, see: Managing Apicurio Registry content using the REST API. Managing Apicurio Registry content using the Maven plug-in. For a Java example, see the Apicurio Registry SerDes with references demonstration. You can use the Apicurio Registry web console to browse and search the schema and API artifacts and optional groups stored in the registry, and to add new schema and API artifacts, groups, and versions. You can search for artifacts by label, name, group, and description. You can view an artifact’s content or its available versions, or download an artifact file locally. You can also configure optional rules for registry content, globally, for groups, and for each schema and API artifact. These optional rules for content validation and compatibility are applied when new schema and API artifacts or versions are uploaded to the registry. For more details, see Apicurio Registry rule reference. Figure 1. Apicurio Registry web console The Apicurio Registry web console is available from http://MY_REGISTRY_UI_URL/. Additional resources Managing Apicurio Registry content using the web console Client applications can use the Core Registry API v3 to manage the schema and API artifacts in Apicurio Registry. This API provides operations for the following features: Admin Export or import Apicurio Registry data in a .zip file, and manage logging levels for the Apicurio Registry at runtime. Groups Manage groups of artifacts in Apicurio Registry. You can create groups to better organize your artifacts. Group Rules Configure rules to govern the content evolution of schemas or API artifacts within a specific group to prevent invalid or incompatible content from being added to Apicurio Registry. Group rules override any global rules configured. Artifacts Manage schema and API artifacts stored in Apicurio Registry. Artifact metadata Manage details about a schema or API artifact. You can edit details such as artifact name, description, or labels. Details such as artifact group, and when the artifact was created or modified are read-only. Artifact rules Configure rules to govern the content evolution of a specific schema or API artifact to prevent invalid or incompatible content from being added to Apicurio Registry. Artifact rules override any group and/or global rules configured. Artifact versions Manage the sequence of versions that make up the content of a schema or API artifact. You can also manage the lifecycle state of an artifact version: enabled, disabled, or deprecated. Global rules Configure rules to govern the content evolution of all schema and API artifacts to prevent invalid or incompatible content from being added to Apicurio Registry. Global rules are applied only if an artifact and its group do not have rules configured. Search Browse or search for schema and API artifacts and versions, for example, by name, group, description, or label. System Get the Apicurio Registry version and the limits on resources for the Apicurio Registry server. Users Get the current Apicurio Registry user. Apicurio Registry also provides compatibility with the following schema registries by including implementations of their respective REST APIs: Apicurio Registry Core Registry API v2 Confluent Schema Registry API v7 Applications using Confluent client libraries can use Apicurio Registry as a drop-in replacement. Additional resources For more information on the Core Registry API v3, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. For API documentation on the Core Registry API v3 and all compatible APIs, browse to the /apis endpoint of your Apicurio Registry, for example, http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis. Apicurio Registry provides the following options for the underlying storage of registry data: Table 1. Apicurio Registry data storage options Storage option Description In-memory The in-memory storage option is suitable for a development environment only. All data is lost when restarting Apicurio Registry with this storage. The PostgreSQL or Kafka storage option is recommended for a production environment. PostgreSQL database PostgreSQL is the recommended data storage option for performance, stability, and data management (backup/restore, and so on) in a production environment. Apache Kafka Kafka storage is provided for production environments where database management expertise is not available, or where storage in Kafka is a specific requirement. Additional resources Installing Apicurio Registry using Docker Installing Apicurio Registry on OpenShift Installing Apicurio Registry storage on OpenShift Kafka producer applications can use serializers to encode messages that conform to a specific event schema. Kafka consumer applications can then use deserializers to validate that messages have been serialized using the correct schema, based on a specific schema ID. Figure 2. Apicurio Registry and Kafka client SerDes architecture Apicurio Registry provides Kafka client serializers/deserializers (SerDes) to validate the following message types at runtime: Apache Avro Google Protobuf JSON Schema The Apicurio Registry Maven repository and source code distributions include the Kafka SerDes implementations for these message types, which Kafka client application developers can use to integrate with Apicurio Registry. These implementations include custom Java classes for each supported message type, for example, io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro, which client applications can use to pull schemas from Apicurio Registry at runtime for validation. Additional resources Validating schemas using Kafka client serializers/deserializers in Java clients You can use Apicurio Registry with Apache Kafka Connect to stream data between Kafka and external systems. Using Kafka Connect, you can define connectors for different systems to move large volumes of data into and out of Kafka-based systems. Figure 3. Apicurio Registry and Kafka Connect architecture Apicurio Registry provides the following features for Kafka Connect: Storage for Kafka Connect schemas Kafka Connect converters for Apache Avro and JSON Schema Core Registry API to manage schemas You can use the Avro and JSON Schema converters to map Kafka Connect schemas into Avro or JSON schemas. These schemas can then serialize message keys and values into the compact Avro binary format or human-readable JSON format. The converted JSON is less verbose because the messages do not contain the schema information, only the schema ID. Apicurio Registry can manage and track the Avro and JSON schemas used in the Kafka topics. Because the schemas are stored in Apicurio Registry and decoupled from the message content, each message must only include a tiny schema identifier. For an I/O bound system like Kafka, this means more total throughput for producers and consumers. The Avro and JSON Schema serializers and deserializers (SerDes) provided by Apicurio Registry are used by Kafka producers and consumers in this use case. Kafka consumer applications that you write to consume change events can use the Avro or JSON SerDes to deserialize these events. You can install the Apicurio Registry SerDes in any Kafka-based system and use them along with Kafka Connect, or with a Kafka Connect-based system such as Debezium. Additional resources Configuring Debezium to use Avro serialization and Apicurio Registry Example of using Debezium to monitor the PostgreSQL database used by Apicurio Registry Apache Kafka Connect documentation Apicurio Registry provides open source example applications that demonstrate how to use Apicurio Registry in different use case scenarios. For example, these include storing schemas used by Kafka serializer and deserializer (SerDes) Java classes. These classes fetch the schema from Apicurio Registry for use when producing or consuming operations to serialize, deserialize, or validate the Kafka message payload. These applications demonstrate use cases such as the following examples: Apache Avro Kafka SerDes Apache Avro Maven plug-in Apache Camel Quarkus and Kafka CloudEvents Confluent Kafka SerDes Custom ID strategy Event-driven architecture with Debezium Google Protobuf Kafka SerDes JSON Schema Kafka SerDes REST clients Additional resources For more details, see https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-registry/tree/main/examples Apicurio Registry provides the following components as part of its distribution.

The Core Registry API v3 provides operations for artifacts, versions, metadata, and rules stored in Apicurio Registry. For detailed information, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. This chapter shows examples of how to use the Core Registry API v3 to perform the following tasks: Managing schema and API artifacts using Apicurio Registry REST API commands Managing schema and API artifact versions using Apicurio Registry REST API commands Managing schema and API artifact references using Apicurio Registry REST API commands Exporting and importing registry data using Apicurio Registry REST API commands Prerequisites Introduction to Apicurio Registry Additional resources Apicurio Registry REST API documentation This section shows a simple curl-based example of using the Core Registry API v3 to add and retrieve a simple schema artifact in Apicurio Registry. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment. Procedure Add an artifact to Apicurio Registry using the /groups/{groupId}/artifacts operation. The following example curl command adds a simple schema artifact for a share price application: $ curl -X POST MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v3/groups/my-group/artifacts \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --data-raw '{ \"artifactId\": \"share-price\", \"artifactType\": \"AVRO\", \"firstVersion\": { \"content\": { \"content\": \"{\\\"type\\\":\\\"record\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\" p\\\",\\\"namespace\\\":\\\"com.example\\\", \\\"fields\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"symbol\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"price\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"}]}\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\" } } }' This example adds an Apache Avro schema artifact with an artifact ID of share-price. If you do not specify a unique artifact ID, Apicurio Registry generates one automatically as a UUID. MY-REGISTRY-URL is the host name on which Apicurio Registry is deployed. For example: http://localhost:8080. This example specifies a group ID of my-group in the API path. If you do not specify a unique group ID, you must specify ../groups/default in the API path. Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body to confirm that the artifact was added. For example: {\"artifact\":{\"owner\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2024-09-26T17:24:21Z\",\"modifiedBy\":\"\",\"modifiedOn\":\"2024-09-26T17:24:21Z\",\"artifactType\":\"AVRO\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"artifactId\":\"share-price\"},\"version\":{\"version\":\"1\",\"owner\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2024-09-26T17:24:21Z\",\"artifactType\":\"AVRO\",\"globalId\":2,\"state\":\"ENABLED\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"contentId\":2,\"artifactId\":\"share-price\"}} No version was specified when adding the artifact, so the default version 1 is created automatically. This was the second artifact added to Apicurio Registry, so the global ID and content ID have a value of 2. Retrieve the artifact version content from Apicurio Registry using its artifact ID in the API path. In this example, the specified ID is share-price: $ curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v3/groups/my-group/artifacts/share-price/versions/1/content {\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"price\",\"namespace\":\"com.example\", \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]} Additional resources For more details, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. If you do not specify an artifact version number when adding schema and API artifacts using the Core Registry API v3, Apicurio Registry generates a version number automatically. The default version when creating a new artifact is 1. Apicurio Registry also supports custom versioning where you can specify a version number when creating the artifact or artifact version. Specifying a custom version value overrides the default version normally assigned when creating an artifact or artifact version. You can then use this version value when executing REST API operations that require a version number. This section shows a simple curl-based example of using the Core Registry API v3 to add and retrieve a custom Apache Avro schema version in Apicurio Registry. You can specify custom version numbers to create artifacts, or to add artifact versions. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment. Procedure Add an artifact version in the registry using the /groups/{groupId}/artifacts operation. The following example curl command adds a simple artifact for a share price application: $ curl -X POST MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v3/groups/my-group/artifacts \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --data-raw '{ \"artifactId\": \"my-share-price\", \"artifactType\": \"AVRO\", \"firstVersion\": { \"version\": \"1.1.1\", \"content\": { \"content\": \"{\\\"type\\\":\\\"record\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\" p\\\",\\\"namespace\\\":\\\"com.example\\\", \\\"fields\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"symbol\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"price\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\"}]}\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\" } } }' This example adds an Avro schema artifact with an artifact ID of my-share-price and version of 1.1.1. If you do not specify a version, Apicurio Registry automatically generates a default version of 1. MY-REGISTRY-URL is the host name on which Apicurio Registry is deployed. For example: http://localhost:8080. This example specifies a group ID of my-group in the API path. If you do not specify a unique group ID, you must specify ../groups/default in the API path. Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body to confirm that the custom artifact version was added. For example: {\"artifact\":{\"owner\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2024-09-26T17:06:21Z\",\"modifiedBy\":\"\",\"modifiedOn\":\"2024-09-26T17:06:21Z\",\"artifactType\":\"AVRO\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"artifactId\":\"my-share-price\"},\"version\":{\"version\":\"1.1.1\",\"owner\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2024-09-26T17:06:21Z\",\"artifactType\":\"AVRO\",\"globalId\":4,\"state\":\"ENABLED\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"contentId\":4,\"artifactId\":\"my-share-price\"}} A custom version of 1.1.1 was specified when adding the artifact. This was the fourth artifact added to the registry, so the global ID and content ID have a value of 4. Retrieve the artifact content from the registry using its artifact ID and version in the API path. In this example, the specified ID is my-share-price and the version is 1.1.1: $ curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v3/groups/my-group/artifacts/my-share-price/versions/1.1.1/content {\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"price\",\"namespace\":\"com.example\", \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]} Additional resources For more details, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. Some Apicurio Registry artifact types can include artifact references from one artifact file to another. You can create efficiencies by defining reusable schema or API artifacts, and then referencing them from multiple locations in artifact references. The following artifact types support artifact references: Apache Avro Google Protobuf JSON Schema OpenAPI AsyncAPI This section shows a simple curl-based example of using the Core Registry API v3 to add and retrieve an artifact reference to a simple Avro schema artifact in Apicurio Registry. This example first creates a schema artifact named ItemId: ItemId schema { \"namespace\":\"com.example.common\", \"name\":\"ItemId\", \"type\":\"record\", \"fields\":[ { \"name\":\"id\", \"type\":\"int\" } ] } This example then creates a schema artifact named Item, which includes a reference to the nested ItemId artifact. Item schema with nested ItemId schema { \"namespace\":\"com.example.common\", \"name\":\"Item\", \"type\":\"record\", \"fields\":[ { \"name\":\"itemId\", \"type\":\"com.example.common.ItemId\" } ] } Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment. Procedure Add the ItemId schema artifact that you want to create the nested artifact reference to using the /groups/{groupId}/artifacts operation: $ curl -X POST MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v3/groups/my-group/artifacts \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --data '{\"artifactId\":\"ItemId\",\"artifactType\":\"AVRO\",\"firstVersion\":{\"version\":\"1.0.0\",\"content\":{\"content\":\"{\\\"namespace\\\":\\\"com.example.common\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"ItemId\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"record\\\",\\\"fields\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"id\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"int\\\"}]}\",\"contentType\":\"application/json\"}}}' This example adds an Avro schema artifact with an artifact ID of ItemId. If you do not specify a unique artifact ID, Apicurio Registry generates one automatically as a UUID. MY-REGISTRY-URL is the host name on which Apicurio Registry is deployed. For example: http://localhost:8080. This example specifies a group ID of my-group in the API path. If you do not specify a unique group ID, you must specify ../groups/default in the API path. Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body to confirm that the artifact was added. For example: {\"artifact\":{\"owner\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2024-09-26T16:27:38Z\",\"modifiedBy\":\"\",\"modifiedOn\":\"2024-09-26T16:27:38Z\",\"artifactType\":\"AVRO\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"artifactId\":\"ItemId\"},\"version\":{\"version\":\"1.0.0\",\"owner\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2024-09-26T16:27:38Z\",\"artifactType\":\"AVRO\",\"globalId\":2,\"state\":\"ENABLED\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"contentId\":2,\"artifactId\":\"ItemId\"}} Add the Item schema artifact that includes the artifact reference to the ItemId schema using the /groups/{groupId}/artifacts operation: $ curl -X POST MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v3/groups/my-group/artifacts \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --data-raw '{ \"artifactId\": \"Item\", \"artifactType\": \"AVRO\", \"firstVersion\": { \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"content\": { \"content\": \"{\\\"namespace\\\":\\\"com.example.common\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Item\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"record\\\",\\\"fields\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"itemId\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"com.example.common.ItemId\\\"}]}\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\", \"references\": [ { \"name\": \"com.example.common.ItemId\", \"groupId\": \"my-group\", \"artifactId\": \"ItemId\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\" } ] } } }' Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body to confirm that the artifact was created with the reference. For example: {\"artifact\":{\"owner\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2024-09-26T16:28:45Z\",\"modifiedBy\":\"\",\"modifiedOn\":\"2024-09-26T16:28:45Z\",\"artifactType\":\"AVRO\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"artifactId\":\"Item\"},\"version\":{\"version\":\"1.0.0\",\"owner\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2024-09-26T16:28:45Z\",\"artifactType\":\"AVRO\",\"globalId\":3,\"state\":\"ENABLED\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"contentId\":3,\"artifactId\":\"Item\"}} Retrieve the artifact reference from Apicurio Registry by specifying the coordinates of the artifact that includes the reference: $ curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v3/groups/my-group/artifacts/Item/versions/1.0.0/references Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body for this artifact reference. For example: [{\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"artifactId\":\"ItemId\",\"version\":\"1.0.0\",\"name\":\"com.example.common.ItemId\"}] Dereference There are some situations where having an artifact’s content with the referenced content inlined might be helpful. For those situations, the Core Registry API v3 supports the references parameter in certain operations. This support is currently implemented for Avro, JSON Schema, Protobuf, OpenAPI and AsyncAPI when the parameter is present in a particular API operation. The parameter is not supported in other schema types. Retrieve the dereferenced (inlined) schema content: $ curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v3/groups/my-group/artifacts/Item/versions/1.0.0/content?references=DEREFERENCE Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body for this artifact content with the references inlined. For example: {\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"Item\",\"namespace\":\"com.example.common\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"itemId\",\"type\":{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"ItemId\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"id\",\"type\":\"int\"}]}}]} This support is currently implemented only for Avro, Protobuf, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema artifacts when the dereference parameter is specified in the API operation. This parameter is not supported for any other artifact types. For Protobuf artifacts, dereferencing content is supported only when all the schemas belong to the same package. Circular dependencies are allowed by some artifact types (e.g. JSON Schema) but are not supported by Apicurio Registry. Additional resources For more details, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. For more examples of artifact references, see the section on configuring each artifact type in Configuring Kafka serializers/deserializers in Java clients. As an administrator, you can use the Core Registry API v3 to export data from one Apicurio Registry instance and import into another Apicurio Registry instance, so you can migrate data between different instances. This section shows a simple curl-based example of using the Core Registry API v3 to export and import existing data in .zip format from one Apicurio Registry instance to another. All the artifact data contained in the Apicurio Registry instance is exported in the .zip file. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment. Apicurio Registry instances have been created: The source instance that you want to export data from contains at least one schema or API artifact. The target instance that you want to import data into is empty to preserve unique IDs. Procedure Export the Apicurio Registry data from your existing source Apicurio Registry instance: $ curl MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v3/admin/export \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --output my-registry-data.zip MY-REGISTRY-URL is the host name on which the source Apicurio Registry is deployed. For example: http://my-source-registry:8080.

RedHat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. For more information about the support scope of RedHat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope. This section shows a simple example of using the Maven plug-in to register an Avro schema and automatically detect and register an artifact reference to a simple schema artifact. This example assumes that the parent TradeKey artifact and the nested Exchange schema artifact are both available in the same directory: TradeKey schema with nested reference to Exchange schema { \"namespace\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.trade\", \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"TradeKey\", \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"exchange\", \"type\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.common.Exchange\" }, { \"name\": \"key\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } Exchange schema { \"namespace\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.common\", \"type\": \"enum\", \"name\": \"Exchange\", \"symbols\" : [\"GEMINI\"] } Prerequisites You have created a Maven project for your client application. For more details, see the Apache Maven documentation. The TradeKey schema artifact and the nested Exchange schema artifact files are both located in the same directory. Procedure Update your Maven pom.xml file to use the apicurio-registry-maven-plugin to register the TradeKey schema, which includes a nested reference to the Exchange schema as follows: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-maven-plugin ${apicurio-registry.version} generate-sources register (1) MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v3 (2) MY-AUTH-SERVER MY-CLIENT-ID MY-CLIENT-SECRET (3) MY-CLIENT-SCOPE test-group (4) TradeKey 2.0 AVRO ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/schemas/TradeKey.avsc (5) FIND_OR_CREATE_VERSION true true (6) 1 Specify register as the execution goal to upload the schema artifacts to Apicurio Registry. 2 Specify the Apicurio Registry URL by using the ../apis/registry/v3 endpoint. 3 If authentication is required, you can specify your authentication server and client credentials. 4 Specify the parent artifact group ID that contains the references. You can specify the default group if you do not want to use a unique group ID. 5 Specify the location of the parent artifact file. All referenced artifacts must also be located in the same directory. 6 Set the option to true to automatically detect and register all references to artifacts in the same directory. You can register multiple artifact references in this way. Build your Maven project, for example, by using the mvn package command. Additional resources For more details on using Apache Maven, see the Apache Maven documentation. For an open source example of using the Apicurio Registry Maven plug-in to automatically register multiple artifact references, see the avro-maven-with-references-auto demonstration example. For more examples of artifact references, see the section on configuring each artifact type in Configuring Kafka serializers/deserializers in Java clients. When connecting to a TLS-enabled Apicurio Registry instance, you can configure the Maven plug-in to use SSL/TLS for secure communication. The plug-in supports various trust store and key store formats, as well as multiple authentication methods. The following table describes the TLS-related configuration options available in the Maven plug-in: Table 1. Trust store configuration Parameter Description trustStorePath Path to the trust store file containing the CA certificate(s) to trust. Supports JKS, PKCS12, and PEM formats. The format is auto-detected from the file extension (.jks, .p12/.pfx, .pem/.crt/.cer) unless explicitly specified. trustStorePassword Password for the trust store. Required for JKS and PKCS12 formats. trustStoreType Explicit trust store type: JKS, PKCS12, or PEM. If not specified, the type is auto-detected from the file extension. Table 2. Key store configuration for mutual TLS (mTLS) Parameter Description keyStorePath Path to the key store file containing the client certificate for mTLS authentication. Supports JKS, PKCS12, and PEM formats. keyStorePassword Password for the key store. Required for JKS and PKCS12 formats. keyStoreType Explicit key store type: JKS, PKCS12, or PEM. If not specified, the type is auto-detected from the file extension. keyStorePemKeyPath Path to the PEM private key file. Required when using PEM format for mTLS, where keyStorePath points to the certificate file. Table 3. Additional SSL options Parameter Default Description trustAll false If set to true, trust all SSL/TLS certificates without validation. WARNING: This should only be used for development or testing purposes. verifyHostname true If set to false, disable hostname verification in SSL/TLS connections. WARNING: Disabling this reduces security and should only be used for development or testing. The following example shows how to configure the Maven plug-in to connect to a TLS-enabled Apicurio Registry using a PKCS12 trust store: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-maven-plugin ${apicurio.version} generate-sources register https://registry.example.com:8443/apis/registry/v3 (1) ${project.basedir}/certs/truststore.p12 (2) ${env.TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD} (3) default MySchema ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/schemas/schema.avsc 1 Use https:// for the registry URL when connecting with TLS. 2 Specify the path to your PKCS12 trust store containing the CA certificate(s). 3 Use environment variables for passwords to avoid storing secrets in your pom.xml. The following example shows how to combine TLS with basic authentication: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-maven-plugin ${apicurio.version} generate-sources register https://registry.example.com:8443/apis/registry/v3 ${project.basedir}/certs/truststore.p12 ${env.TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD} ${env.REGISTRY_USERNAME} (1) ${env.REGISTRY_PASSWORD} default MySchema ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/schemas/schema.avsc 1 Combine TLS configuration with basic authentication credentials. The following example shows how to configure TLS with OAuth2/OIDC client credentials authentication: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-maven-plugin ${apicurio.version} generate-sources register https://registry.example.com:8443/apis/registry/v3 ${project.basedir}/certs/truststore.p12 ${env.TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD} https://keycloak.example.com/realms/registry/protocol/openid-connect/token (1) ${env.CLIENT_ID} ${env.CLIENT_SECRET} openid default MySchema ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/schemas/schema.avsc 1 Specify the OAuth2/OIDC token endpoint URL for authentication. The following example shows how to configure mutual TLS where both the client and server authenticate each other using certificates: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-maven-plugin ${apicurio.version} generate-sources register https://registry.example.com:8443/apis/registry/v3 ${project.basedir}/certs/truststore.p12 (1) ${env.TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD} ${project.basedir}/certs/client-keystore.p12 (2) ${env.KEYSTORE_PASSWORD} default MySchema ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/schemas/schema.avsc 1 Trust store to verify the server’s certificate. 2 Key store containing the client certificate for authentication. The following example shows how to use PEM-formatted certificates: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-maven-plugin ${apicurio.version} generate-sources register https://registry.example.com:8443/apis/registry/v3 ${project.basedir}/certs/ca-cert.pem (1) PEM default MySchema ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/schemas/schema.avsc 1 PEM certificate files do not require a password. The following example shows mTLS configuration using PEM-formatted certificate and key files: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-maven-plugin ${apicurio.version} generate-sources register https://registry.example.com:8443/apis/registry/v3 ${project.basedir}/certs/ca-cert.pem PEM ${project.basedir}/certs/client-cert.pem (1) ${project.basedir}/certs/client-key.pem (2) PEM default MySchema ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/schemas/schema.avsc 1 Path to the client certificate PEM file. 2 Path to the client private key PEM file.

Prerequisites You have already installed Apicurio Registry. When you access the Apicurio Registry web console in your browser, some initial configuration settings are loaded. The following configuration settings are required: URL for core Apicurio Registry server REST API v3 Typically the Apicurio Registry Operator will automatically configure the UI component with the REST API v3 URL. However, you can override this value by configuring the appropriate environment variable in the UI component deployment configuration. Procedure Configure the following environment variables to override the default URL: REGISTRY_API_URL: Specifies the URL for the core Apicurio Registry server REST API v3. For example, https://registry-api.my-domain.com/apis/registry/v3 You can configure the Apicurio Registry web console in read-only mode as an optional feature. This mode disables all features in the Apicurio Registry web console that allow users to make changes to registered artifacts. For example, this includes the following: Creating a group Creating an artifact Uploading a new artifact version Updating artifact metadata Deleting an artifact Procedure Configure the following environment variable: REGISTRY_FEATURE_READ_ONLY: Set to true to enable read-only mode. Defaults to false. You can use the Apicurio Registry web console to browse the schema and API artifacts stored in Apicurio Registry. This section shows a simple example of viewing Apicurio Registry groups, artifacts, versions, and rules. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment. You are logged in to the Apicurio Registry web console: http://MY_REGISTRY_UI_URL/ Artifacts have been added to Apicurio Registry using the web console, command line, Maven plug-in, or a client application. Procedure On the Explore tab, browse the list of artifacts stored in Apicurio Registry, or enter a search string to find an artifact. You can select from the list to search by specific criteria such as name, group, labels, or global ID. Figure 1. Artifacts in Apicurio Registry web console Click an artifact to view the following details: Overview: Displays artifact metadata such as artifact ID, name, description, labels, and so on. Also displays rules for validity and compatibility that you can configure for artifact content. Versions: Displays a list of all artifact versions. This will be empty unless you chose to upload a first version when you created the artifact. Branches: Displays a list of branches for the artifact. This will display at least the latest branch, but might display other generated branches depending on your configuration. Figure 2. Artifact details in Apicurio Registry web console Click the Versions tab to view a list of all artifact versions. Then click one of the versions in the list, or choose View Version from the Action menu for a version in the list.

Now you can click the Create button to create the new version. To delete an artifact, click Delete in the page header. Deleting an artifact deletes the artifact and all of its versions, and cannot be undone. Additional resources Viewing artifacts using the Apicurio Registry web console Configuring content rules using the Apicurio Registry web console Apicurio Registry rule reference You can use the Apicurio Registry web console to configure optional rules to prevent invalid or incompatible content from being added to Apicurio Registry. All configured artifact-specific, group-specific, or global rules must pass before a new artifact version can be uploaded to Apicurio Registry. Configured artifact-specific rules override any configured group-specific rules, which in turn override any global rules. This section shows a simple example of configuring global, group-specific, and artifact-specific rules. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment. You are logged in to the Apicurio Registry web console: http://MY_REGISTRY_UI_URL/ Artifacts have been added to Apicurio Registry using the web console, command line, Maven plug-in, or a Java client application. When role-based authorization is enabled, you have administrator access for global rules configuration. Procedure (group-specific rules) On the Explore tab, browse the list of groups in Apicurio Registry by selecting Groups from the \"Search for\" menu. Click a group to view its details and content rules. In Group-specific rules, click Enable to configure a validity, compatibility, or integrity rule for all artifact content in the group, and select the appropriate rule configuration from the list. For example, for Validity rule, select Full. Figure 5. Group-specific rules in Apicurio Registry web console Procedure (artifact-specific rules) On the Explore tab, browse the list of artifacts in Apicurio Registry by selecting Artifacts from the \"Search for\" menu. Click an artifact from the list to view its details and content rules. In Artifact-specific rules, click Enable to configure a validity, compatibility, or integrity rule for artifact content, and select the appropriate rule configuration from the list. For example, for Validity rule, select Full. Figure 6. Artifact content rules in Apicurio Registry web console Procedure (global rules) To access global rules, click the Global rules tab. Click Enable to configure global validity, compatibility, or integrity rules for all artifact content, and select the appropriate rule configuration from the list. Figure 7. Artifact content rules in Apicurio Registry web console To disable an artifact-specific, group-specific, or global rule, click the trash icon next to the rule. If you do this, and the rule is configured at a higher level (e.g. Global), then the higher level rule configuration will once again be applied. Additional resources Adding artifacts using the Apicurio Registry web console Apicurio Registry rule reference As an administrator or as an owner of a schema or API artifact, you can use the Apicurio Registry web console to change the artifact owner to another user account. For example, this feature is useful if the Artifact owner-only authorization option is set for the Apicurio Registry on the Settings tab so that only owners or administrators can modify artifacts. You might need to change owner if the owner user leaves the organization or the owner account is deleted. Or if you simply need to transition modification authorization to a new user. The Artifact owner-only authorization setting and the artifact Owner field are displayed only if authentication was enabled when the Apicurio Registry was deployed. For more details, see Configuring your Apicurio Registry deployment. Prerequisites The Apicurio Registry is deployed and the artifact is created. You are logged in to the Apicurio Registry web console as the artifact’s current owner or as an administrator: http://MY_REGISTRY_UI_URL/ Procedure On the Explore tab, browse the list of artifacts stored in Apicurio Registry, or enter a search string to find the artifact. You can select from the list to search by criteria such as name, group, labels, or global ID. Click the artifact that you want to reassign. In the Overview section, click the pencil icon next to the Owner field. In the New owner field, select or enter an account name. Click Change owner. Additional resources Configuring your Apicurio Registry deployment As an administrator, you can use the Apicurio Registry web console to configure dynamic settings for Apicurio Registry at runtime.

Additional resources Configuring your Apicurio Registry deployment As an administrator, you can use the Apicurio Registry web console to export data from one Apicurio Registry instance, and import this data into another Apicurio Registry instance. You can use this feature to easily migrate data between different instances. The following example shows how to export and import existing data in a .zip file from one Apicurio Registry instance to another instance. All the artifact data contained in the Apicurio Registry instance is exported in the .zip file. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry instances have been created as follows: The source instance that you are exporting from contains at least one schema or API artifact The target instance that you are importing into is empty to preserve unique IDs You are logged into the Apicurio Registry web console with administrator access: http://MY_REGISTRY_UI_URL/ Procedure In the web console for the source Apicurio Registry instance, view the Explore tab. Click the additional actions icon (three vertical dots) next to Create artifact in the toolbar, and select Export all (as .ZIP) to export the data for this Apicurio Registry instance to a .zip download file. In the web console for the target Apicurio Registry instance, view the Explore tab. Click the additional actions icon (three vertical dots) next to Create artifact in the toolbar, and select Import from .ZIP. Drag and drop or browse to the .zip download file that you exported earlier. Click Import and wait for the data to be imported.","title":"Managing Apicurio Registry content using the web console","component":"apicurio-registry","version":"3.1.x","name":"assembly-managing-registry-artifacts-ui","url":"/apicurio-registry/3.1.x/getting-started/assembly-managing-registry-artifacts-ui.html","titles":[{"text":"Configuring the Apicurio Registry web console","id":"configuring-registry-ui_registry"},{"text":"Configuring the web console deployment environment","id":"_configuring_the_web_console_deployment_environment"},{"text":"Configuring the web console in read-only mode","id":"_configuring_the_web_console_in_read_only_mode"},{"text":"Viewing artifacts using the Apicurio Registry web console","id":"browsing-artifacts-using-console_registry"},{"text":"Adding artifacts using the Apicurio Registry web console","id":"adding-artifacts-using-console_registry"},{"text":"Configuring content rules using the Apicurio Registry web console","id":"configuring-rules-using-console_registry"},{"text":"Changing an artifact owner using the Apicurio Registry web console","id":"changing-artifact-owner-using-console_registry"},{"text":"Configuring Apicurio Registry settings using the web console","id":"configuring-settings-using-console_registry"},{"text":"Exporting and importing data using the Apicurio Registry web console","id":"exporting-importing-using-web-console_registry"}]},"/apicurio-registry/3.1.x/getting-started/assembly-migrating-registry-v2-v3.html":{"text":"This chapter explains how to migrate an existing Apicurio Registry deployment from version 2.x to version 3.x. Migration from Apicurio Registry 2.x to 3.x Migrating Apicurio Registry data Migrating Apicurio Registry client applications Apicurio Registry 3.x includes new features with breaking changes from the previous Apicurio Registry 2.x release. This section describes the major changes between Apicurio Registry 2.x and version 3.x, along with the best approach to migrating. Because of the breaking changes in 3.x, there is no automatic upgrade and a migration process is required. This involves exporting the data in your existing registry to a new registry. You must also review your existing registry client applications and update their configurations to meet the new requirements. When migrating to version 3.x, you must take the following major changes into account: All of the storage options from 2.x continue to be supported in 3.x, but any data currently in either the Kafka topic or in the database is no longer compatible with 3.x. This means that, in order to migrate from 2.x to 3.x, you will need to use the Export feature of Apicurio Registry to create a .ZIP file containing all of your 2.x data. The in-memory storage option is also still available, but is not suitable for production workloads. For details on how to deploy Apicurio Registry 3.x with your chosen storage option, see Installing Apicurio Registry storage on OpenShift. Apicurio Registry 3.x includes a new REST API with support for empty artifacts, artifact branches, group level rules, new search capabilities, and much more. Apicurio Registry still supports version 2.x of the core REST API as well as various compatibility APIs, for example, the Confluent schema registry API v7. However, version 2 of the Core REST API is now deprecated. The Apicurio Registry Java client classes are no longer available in version 3.x and have been replaced by a new SDK generated using Kiota. In addition to Java, SDKs are now provided for Typescript, Python, and Golang. The Kafka client serializer and deserializer (SerDes) classes are available in version 3.x…​. Apicurio Registry 3.x has changed a number of configuration options and added some new ones. Options you may be using when deploying 2.x are likely still available, but may have been renamed. This is a critical breaking change that affects Kafka message compatibility. In Apicurio Registry 2.x, the SerDes libraries used 8 bytes (long) to encode schema identifiers in Kafka messages, and used the globalId by default. In Apicurio Registry 3.x, the SerDes libraries now use 4 bytes (int) to encode identifiers and use the contentId by default. This change aligns with the Confluent Schema Registry wire format. This means that: Kafka messages produced with 2.x SerDes cannot be consumed by 3.x SerDes (and vice versa) without additional configuration. Existing Kafka topics with messages serialized using 2.x SerDes will fail to deserialize with 3.x SerDes unless you configure backward compatibility. To consume messages that were produced using Apicurio Registry 2.x SerDes, you must configure your 3.x consumers to use the legacy 8-byte ID handler: props.put(\"apicurio.registry.id-handler\", \"io.apicurio.registry.serde.Legacy8ByteIdHandler\"); props.put(\"apicurio.registry.use-id\", \"globalId\"); Setting Apicurio Registry 2.x Default Apicurio Registry 3.x Default ID size 8 bytes (long) 4 bytes (int) ID handler class Legacy8ByteIdHandler Default4ByteIdHandler ID type globalId contentId There are two approaches to handle this breaking change: Configure 3.x SerDes for backward compatibility (recommended for existing topics): Use the Legacy8ByteIdHandler configuration shown above. This allows 3.x consumers to read messages produced by 2.x producers. Migrate to new format (recommended for new deployments): Accept the new 4-byte format. This requires that all producers and consumers are upgraded to 3.x simultaneously, or that you create new Kafka topics for 3.x usage. The 4-byte format is more efficient and aligns with the Confluent Schema Registry wire format, making interoperability easier. Additional resources For more details on the v3 REST API, see the Registry REST API documentation. Migrating data to Apicurio Registry 3.x requires exporting all data from your existing Apicurio Registry 2.x deployment and importing it into the new 3.x deployment. If you are using Apicurio Registry as a schema registry for Kafka applications, data migration is critical because each Kafka message carries the global identifier for the schema stored in Apicurio Registry. This identifier must be preserved during registry data migration. Both Apicurio Registry 3.x and 2.x provide an API to bulk import/export all data from your registry deployment, which guarantees that all identifiers are kept when importing data from your existing registry. The export API downloads a custom .zip file containing all the information for your artifacts. The import API accepts this .zip and loads all artifacts into the registry in a single batch. The Apicurio Registry 3.x import feature is able to import .zip contents created from either a 2.x or 3.x deployment. Prerequisites Running a Apicurio Registry instance of the 2.x server you are exporting from and the 3.x instance you are importing into. Procedure Export all the data from Apicurio Registry 2.x using the Export feature, which can be accessed from the UI or the REST API. This generates a all-artifacts.zip file in a directory of your choice. Import the .zip file into Apicurio Registry 3.x using the import API: curl -X POST \"http://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v3/admin/import\" \\ -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/zip\" \\ --data-binary @all-artifacts.zip Check that all the artifacts have been imported into the new 3.x registry by running these commands and comparing the count field: curl \"http://old-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v2/search/artifacts\" curl \"http://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v3/search/artifacts\" Additional resources For more details on the import/export REST API, see Managing Apicurio Registry content using the REST API You must review your existing Apicurio Registry client applications to ensure that the Maven dependencies and Java client configuration meet the new requirements for version 3.x. For example, this includes new Maven dependencies for the Apicurio Registry Java REST client libraries or Kafka client serializer/deserializer (Serdes) libraries. You must also update your Java application configuration with the new registry v3 API path. Prerequisites Existing Apicurio Registry 2.6.3 Java client application or Kafka client producer and consumer Java applications with SerDes Procedure If you are using the Apicurio Registry Java REST client, you must change the Maven dependencies for the Apicurio Registry Java client libraries, which have been repackaged in version 3.x: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-java-sdk 3.1.0 In your Java client application, you must change your registry URL configuration, from pointing to the existing v2 API path to the new v3 path. Starting with v3, we use Vertx as the default platform for our rest client, due to this change, a RequestAdapter is required when the client is created. For example: public class ClientExample { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { VertXRequestAdapter vertXRequestAdapter = new VertXRequestAdapter(vertx); vertXRequestAdapter.setBaseUrl(\"https://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v3\"); RegistryClient client = new RegistryClient(vertXRequestAdapter); } } You can find more details on the Java client in Managing Apicurio Registry content using a Java client. If you are using the Apicurio Registry SerDes libraries, you must change the Maven dependencies, which have been repackaged in version 3.x. In Apicurio Registry 2.6.3, the SerDes libraries were provided into three separate Maven modules, while this is still true, the names have been changed: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-avro-serde-kafka 3.1.0 io.apicurio apicurio-registry-jsonschema-serde-kafka 3.1.0 io.apicurio apicurio-registry-protobuf-serde-kafka 3.1.0 In Apicurio Registry 3.x, the SerDes libraries have been significantly refactored to make them re-usable for other messaging platforms like Apache Pulsar, that’s why the Apache Kafka specific ones have been renamed. The SerDes ID encoding format has changed from 8 bytes to 4 bytes. See SerDes ID encoding has changed for details on configuring backward compatibility with existing Kafka topics. If you have existing Kafka topics with messages serialized using Apicurio Registry 2.x SerDes, configure the legacy ID handler: props.put(\"apicurio.registry.id-handler\", \"io.apicurio.registry.serde.Legacy8ByteIdHandler\"); props.put(\"apicurio.registry.use-id\", \"globalId\"); In your Kafka producer and consumer Java applications, you must change your registry URL configuration from pointing to the existing v2 API path to the new v3 path. For example: Existing registry v2 API path: props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.REGISTRY_URL, \"http://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v3\"); New registry v3 API path: props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.REGISTRY_URL, \"http://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v3\"); The refactored SerDes libraries also include other important changes to configuration properties. For more details on SerDes configuration, see Validating schemas using Kafka client serializers/deserializers in Java clients.

These pods can scale horizontally and are distributed across cluster nodes for fault tolerance. UI pods - Multiple stateless replicas serving the web console (static files). Typically fewer replicas are needed compared to the backend. Storage layer - The stateful component requiring HA configuration. Strategy depends on whether you use SQL database or KafkaSQL storage. The application and UI components are stateless and can be scaled horizontally. High availability is achieved by running multiple replicas distributed across failure domains (availability zones) and implementing a highly available storage layer. The Apicurio Registry backend and UI components are stateless and can scale horizontally to provide high availability and increased throughput. Configure the number of replicas for each component in the ApicurioRegistry3 custom resource: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry3 metadata: name: example-registry-ha spec: app: replicas: 3 storage: type: postgresql sql: dataSource: url: jdbc:postgresql://postgresql-ha.my-project.svc:5432/registry username: registry_user password: name: postgresql-credentials key: password ingress: host: registry.example.com ui: replicas: 2 ingress: host: registry-ui.example.com Running multiple replicas requires a production-ready storage backend (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or KafkaSQL with persistent Kafka). Do not use in-memory storage with multiple replicas. To ensure high availability, distribute Apicurio Registry pods across different nodes and availability zones: spec: app: replicas: 3 podTemplateSpec: spec: affinity: podAntiAffinity: preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - weight: 100 podAffinityTerm: labelSelector: matchLabels: app: example-registry app.kubernetes.io/component: app app.kubernetes.io/part-of: apicurio-registry topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname - weight: 50 podAffinityTerm: labelSelector: matchLabels: app: example-registry app.kubernetes.io/component: app app.kubernetes.io/part-of: apicurio-registry topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone This configuration spreads pods across different nodes (hostname) and availability zones when possible.

The database must be configured with replication and automatic failover. MySQL storage is not yet supported by the operator and requires manual configuration using environment variables. Consider these database HA strategies: PostgreSQL with streaming replication - Primary-replica configuration with automatic failover using tools like Patroni, CloudNativePG, or Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator PostgreSQL with synchronous replication - Ensures zero data loss but may impact performance MySQL with Group Replication - Multi-primary or single-primary mode with automatic failover Managed database services - Cloud provider managed databases (RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure Database) with built-in HA Configure the Agroal connection pool to handle database failover gracefully. Add these environment variables to the app component: spec: app: env: # Connection pool sizing - name: APICURIO_DATASOURCE_JDBC_INITIAL-SIZE value: \"10\" - name: APICURIO_DATASOURCE_JDBC_MIN-SIZE value: \"10\" - name: APICURIO_DATASOURCE_JDBC_MAX-SIZE value: \"50\" # Connection acquisition timeout (5 seconds) - name: QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_ACQUISITION-TIMEOUT value: \"5S\" # Background validation to detect stale connections (every 2 minutes) - name: QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_BACKGROUND-VALIDATION-INTERVAL value: \"2M\" # Foreground validation before use (every 1 minute) - name: QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_FOREGROUND-VALIDATION-INTERVAL value: \"1M\" # Maximum connection lifetime (30 minutes) - name: QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_MAX-LIFETIME value: \"30M\" These settings ensure that: Connections are validated regularly to detect database failovers Stale connections are removed and recreated Connection acquisition times out rather than hanging indefinitely When using the CloudNativePG operator for PostgreSQL HA: apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 kind: Cluster metadata: name: registry-db-cluster spec: instances: 3 storage: size: 20Gi storageClass: standard postgresql: parameters: max_connections: \"200\" backup: barmanObjectStore: # Configure backup storage Then reference the cluster in your ApicurioRegistry3 CR: spec: app: storage: type: postgresql sql: dataSource: url: jdbc:postgresql://registry-db-cluster-rw:5432/app username: app password: name: registry-db-cluster-app key: password When using KafkaSQL storage, high availability depends on the Kafka cluster configuration. Each Apicurio Registry replica independently consumes all messages from the Kafka journal topic. Configure your Kafka cluster for high availability: apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2 kind: Kafka metadata: name: registry-kafka spec: kafka: version: 3.5.0 replicas: 3 config: # Replication settings for HA offsets.topic.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.min.isr: 2 default.replication.factor: 3 min.insync.replicas: 2 storage: type: persistent-claim size: 100Gi zookeeper: replicas: 3 storage: type: persistent-claim size: 10Gi Key configuration for HA: Kafka replicas: 3 - Provides fault tolerance for broker failures Replication factor: 3 - Each partition has 3 copies min.insync.replicas: 2 - Requires at least 2 replicas to acknowledge writes Apicurio Registry uses three Kafka topics for various purposes: Journal topic - Stores all changes to the registry data. Named kafkasql-journal by default and is the most important topic for data durability. Snapshots topic - Stores periodic snapshots of the registry state for faster startup, if the snapshotting feature is used. It’s named kafkasql-snapshots by default and should be configured with similar replication settings as the journal topic. Events topic - Stores events to support Kafka-based Registry eventing feature. Named registry-events by default, its configuration depends on your event processing needs. Currently, Apicurio Registry sends messages to only 1 partition of this topic. Configure the Kafka topics used by Apicurio Registry with appropriate replication: apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2 kind: KafkaTopic metadata: name: kafkasql-journal labels: strimzi.io/cluster: registry-kafka spec: partitions: 3 replicas: 3 config: cleanup.policy: delete min.insync.replicas: 2 retention.ms: -1 # Infinite retention retention.bytes: -1 # Infinite retention The journal topic and the snapshots topic must use cleanup.policy: delete with infinite retention (retention.ms: -1 and retention.bytes: -1) to prevent accidental data loss. As of the latest version, Apicurio Registry will check these settings on startup and refuse to start if they are not configured correctly. Apicurio Registry automatically creates the journal, snapshots, and events topics on startup by default, if they do not exist. While this is not recommended in a high-availability production scenario, if you want the topics to be created automatically, the following environment variables provide the equivalent configuration: APICURIO_KAFKASQL_TOPIC_PARTITIONS=3 APICURIO_KAFKASQL_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR=3 APICURIO_KAFKASQL_TOPIC_MIN_INSYNC_REPLICAS=2 APICURIO_KAFKASQL_SNAPSHOTS_TOPIC_PARTITIONS=3 APICURIO_KAFKASQL_SNAPSHOTS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR=3 APICURIO_KAFKASQL_SNAPSHOTS_TOPIC_MIN_INSYNC_REPLICAS=2 When running multiple Apicurio Registry replicas with KafkaSQL storage: Each replica uses a unique consumer group ID (automatically generated using UUID) Each replica independently consumes all messages from the journal topic There is no consumer group rebalancing between replicas All replicas build the same in-memory state from the Kafka topic This design ensures that: New replicas can be added without affecting existing replicas Pod restarts only affect the restarting pod, not others Each replica maintains a consistent view of the data Apicurio Registry exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring application health and performance. Metrics are enabled by default. Access the metrics endpoint at /q/metrics. Monitor these metrics for HA deployments: REST API metrics: http_server_requests_seconds - Request latency http_server_active_requests - Concurrent requests http_server_requests_total - Total request count Storage metrics: apicurio_storage_operation_seconds - Storage operation latency apicurio_storage_concurrent_operations - Concurrent storage operations apicurio_storage_operation_total - Total storage operations Health check metrics: Readiness probe: /q/health/ready Liveness probe: /q/health/live JVM metrics: jvm_memory_used_bytes - Memory usage jvm_gc_pause_seconds - Garbage collection pauses If using the Prometheus Operator, create a ServiceMonitor to scrape metrics: apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1 kind: ServiceMonitor metadata: name: apicurio-registry-metrics labels: app: apicurio-registry spec: selector: matchLabels: app: apicurio-registry endpoints: - port: http path: /q/metrics interval: 30s Configure alerts for: Pod restarts or crash loops High error rates (5xx responses) Storage operation timeouts Database connection pool exhaustion Kafka consumer lag (for KafkaSQL storage) When updating Apicurio Registry to a new version, use rolling updates to minimize downtime. The operator performs rolling updates automatically when you update the ApicurioRegistry3 CR. The default strategy ensures: Pods are updated one at a time Each new pod must pass readiness checks before the next pod is updated PodDisruptionBudget prevents too many pods being unavailable Apicurio Registry and Apicurio Registry Operator are versioned together. To update Apicurio Registry to a new version, update Apicurio Registry Operator, which will automatically update the application. For production environments, we strongly recommend using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) with manual install plan confirmation enabled. This prevents automatic updates from occurring immediately when a new version becomes available, giving you time to review release notes and prepare for the update. If you need to update the application without updating Apicurio Registry Operator (not recommended except as a workaround for critical issues), you can override the application image in your pod template: spec: app: podTemplateSpec: spec: containers: - name: apicurio-registry-app image: quay.io/apicurio/apicurio-registry:3.1.0 Follow these practices for safe updates: Test in non-production first - Validate the new version in a test environment Monitor during rollout - Watch metrics and logs during the update Maintain minimum replicas - Keep at least 2 replicas to ensure availability during updates Review release notes - Check for breaking changes or migration steps For patch releases (e.g., 3.1.0 to 3.1.1), rolling updates typically complete without issues. For major or minor version updates, always review the migration guide. Regular backups are essential for disaster recovery and data protection. For SQL storage (PostgreSQL or MySQL), backup strategies depend on your database setup: pg_dump logical backups: pg_dump -h postgresql-host -U registry_user -d registry > registry-backup.sql Continuous archiving with WAL - For point-in-time recovery Operator-managed backups - If using CloudNativePG or Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator: spec: backup: barmanObjectStore: destinationPath: s3://my-backups/registry-db s3Credentials: accessKeyId: name: backup-credentials key: ACCESS_KEY_ID secretAccessKey: name: backup-credentials key: ACCESS_SECRET_KEY wal: compression: gzip retentionPolicy: \"30d\" mysqldump logical backups: mysqldump -h mysql-host -u registry_user -p registry > registry-backup.sql Binary backups - Using tools like Percona XtraBackup or MySQL Enterprise Backup To restore from a logical backup: # PostgreSQL psql -h postgresql-host -U registry_user -d registry < registry-backup.sql # MySQL mysql -h mysql-host -u registry_user -p registry < registry-backup.sql For KafkaSQL storage, back up the Kafka journal topic and snapshots topic. Use Kafka’s MirrorMaker 2 or Strimzi Mirror Maker for topic replication (recommended): apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2 kind: KafkaMirrorMaker2 metadata: name: registry-backup-mirror spec: version: 3.5.0 replicas: 1 connectCluster: \"backup-cluster\" clusters: - alias: \"source-cluster\" bootstrapServers: registry-kafka-bootstrap:9092 - alias: \"backup-cluster\" bootstrapServers: backup-kafka-bootstrap:9092 mirrors: - sourceCluster: \"source-cluster\" targetCluster: \"backup-cluster\" topicsPattern: \"kafkasql-.*\" groupsPattern: \".*\" Alternatively, export and import topics using Kafka’s console consumer or CLI tools like kcat/kafkacat. Since the topics might contain binary data, which might be affected by text file encoding, make sure they are exported correctly when using CLI tools. See our Exporting Apicurio Registry Kafka topic data guide for more details.

Kafka producer applications use serializers to encode messages that conform to a specific event schema. Kafka consumer applications use deserializers to validate that messages have been serialized using the correct schema, based on a specific schema ID. This ensures consistent schema use and helps to prevent data errors at runtime. This chapter explains how to use Kafka client SerDes in your producer and consumer client applications: Kafka client applications and Apicurio Registry Strategies to look up a schema in Apicurio Registry Registering a schema in Apicurio Registry Using a schema from a Kafka consumer client Using a schema from a Kafka producer client Using a schema from a Kafka Streams application Prerequisites You have read Introduction to Apicurio Registry. You have installed Apicurio Registry. You have created Kafka producer and consumer client applications. Apicurio Registry decouples schema management from client application configuration. You can enable a Java client application to use a schema from Apicurio Registry by specifying its URL in your client code. You can store the schemas in Apicurio Registry to serialize and deserialize messages, which are referenced from your client applications to ensure that the messages that they send and receive are compatible with those schemas. Kafka client applications can push or pull their schemas from Apicurio Registry at runtime. Schemas can evolve, so you can define rules in Apicurio Registry, for example, to ensure that schema changes are valid and do not break previous versions used by applications. Apicurio Registry checks for compatibility by comparing a modified schema with previous schema versions. Apicurio Registry provides schema registry support for schema technologies such as: Avro Protobuf JSON Schema These schema technologies can be used by client applications through the Kafka client serializer/deserializer (SerDes) services provided by Apicurio Registry. The maturity and usage of the SerDes classes provided by Apicurio Registry might vary. The sections that follow provide more details about each schema type. A producer client application uses a serializer to put the messages that it sends to a specific broker topic into the correct data format. To enable a producer to use Apicurio Registry for serialization: Define and register your schema with Apicurio Registry (if it does not already exist). Configure your producer client code with the following: URL of Apicurio Registry Apicurio Registry serializer to use with messages Strategy to map the Kafka message to a schema artifact in Apicurio Registry Strategy to look up or register the schema used for serialization in Apicurio Registry After registering your schema, when you start Kafka and Apicurio Registry, you can access the schema to format messages sent to the Kafka broker topic by the producer. Alternatively, depending on configuration, the producer can automatically register the schema on first use. If a schema already exists, you can create a new version using the registry REST API based on compatibility rules defined in Apicurio Registry. Versions are used for compatibility checking as a schema evolves. A group ID, artifact ID, and version represents a unique tuple that identifies a schema. A consumer client application uses a deserializer to get the messages that it consumes from a specific broker topic into the correct data format. To enable a consumer to use Apicurio Registry for deserialization: Define and register your schema with Apicurio Registry (if it does not already exist) Configure the consumer client code with the following: URL of Apicurio Registry Apicurio Registry deserializer to use with the messages Input data stream for deserialization Retrieve schemas using a content ID By default, the schema is retrieved from Apicurio Registry by the deserializer using a content ID (which is an ID unique to the content of an artifact version, but not unique to the version itself), which is specified in the message being consumed. The schema content ID can be located in the message headers or in the message payload, depending on the configuration of the producer application. By default, the content ID will be located in the message body. When locating the content ID in the message payload, the format of the data begins with a magic byte, used as a signal to consumers, followed by the content ID, and the message data as normal. For example: # ... [MAGIC_BYTE] [CONTENT_ID] [MESSAGE DATA] Then when you start Kafka and Apicurio Registry, you can access the schema to format messages received from the Kafka broker topic. Retrieve schemas using a global ID Alternatively, you can configure to retrieve schemas from Apicurio Registry based on the global ID, which is the unique ID of the artifact version. The same options are available to you when using global ID instead of contentID. You can either send the global ID in the message headers or the message body (default). When locating the global ID in the message payload, the format of the data begins with a magic byte, used as a signal to consumers, followed by the global ID, and the message data as normal. For example: # ... [MAGIC_BYTE] [GLOBAL_ID] [MESSAGE DATA] The Kafka client serializer uses lookup strategies to determine the artifact ID and global ID under which the message schema is registered in Apicurio Registry. For a given topic and message, you can use different implementations of the ArtifactReferenceResolverStrategy Java interface to return a reference to an artifact in the registry. The classes for each strategy are in the io.apicurio.registry.serde.strategy package. Specific strategy classes for Avro SerDes are in the io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro.strategy package. The default strategy is the TopicIdStrategy, which looks for Apicurio Registry artifacts with the same name as the Kafka topic receiving messages. Example public ArtifactReference artifactReference(String topic, boolean isKey, T schema) { return ArtifactReference.builder() .groupId(null) .artifactId(String.format(\"%s-%s\", topic, isKey ? \"key\" : \"value\")) .build(); The topic parameter is the name of the Kafka topic receiving the message. The isKey parameter is true when the message key is serialized, and false when the message value is serialized. The schema parameter is the schema of the message serialized or deserialized. The ArtifactReference returned contains the artifact ID under which the schema is registered. Which lookup strategy you use depends on how and where you store your schema. For example, you might use a strategy that uses a record ID if you have different Kafka topics with the same Avro message type. The artifact resolver strategy provides a way to map the Kafka topic and message information to an artifact in Apicurio Registry. The common convention for the mapping is to combine the Kafka topic name with the key or value, depending on whether the serializer is used for the Kafka message key or value. However, you can use alternative conventions for the mapping by using a strategy provided by Apicurio Registry, or by creating a custom Java class that implements io.apicurio.registry.serde.strategy.ArtifactReferenceResolverStrategy. Apicurio Registry provides the following strategies to return a reference to an artifact based on an implementation of ArtifactReferenceResolverStrategy: RecordIdStrategy Avro-specific strategy that uses the full name of the schema. TopicRecordIdStrategy Avro-specific strategy that uses the topic name and the full name of the schema. TopicIdStrategy Default strategy that uses the topic name and key or value suffix. SimpleTopicIdStrategy Simple strategy that only uses the topic name. The default schema resolver locates and identifies the specific version of the schema registered under the artifact reference provided by the artifact resolver strategy. Every version of every artifact has a single globally unique identifier that can be used to retrieve the content of that artifact. This global ID is included in every Kafka message so that a deserializer can properly fetch the schema from Apicurio Registry. The default schema resolver can look up an existing artifact version, or it can register one if not found, depending on which strategy is used. You can also provide your own strategy by creating a custom Java class that implements io.apicurio.registry.resolver.SchemaResolver. However, it is recommended to use the DefaultSchemaResolver and specify configuration properties instead. When using the DefaultSchemaResolver, you can configure its behavior using application properties. The following table shows some commonly used examples: Table 1. Apicurio Registry lookup configuration options Property Type Description Default apicurio.registry.find-latest boolean Specify whether the serializer tries to find the latest artifact in the registry for the corresponding group ID and artifact ID. false apicurio.registry.use-id String Instructs the serializer to write the specified ID to Kafka and instructs the deserializer to use this ID to find the schema. None apicurio.registry.auto-register boolean Specify whether the serializer tries to create an artifact in the registry. The JSON Schema serializer does not support this. false apicurio.registry.check-period-ms String Specify how long to cache the global ID in milliseconds. If not configured, the global ID is fetched every time. None After you have defined a schema in the appropriate format, such as Apache Avro, you can add the schema to Apicurio Registry. You can add the schema using the following approaches: Apicurio Registry web console curl command using the Apicurio Registry REST API Maven plug-in supplied with Apicurio Registry Schema configuration added to your client code Client applications cannot use Apicurio Registry until you have registered your schemas. When Apicurio Registry is installed, you can connect to the web console from the ui endpoint: http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/ui From the console, you can add, view and configure schemas. You can also create the rules that prevent invalid content being added to the registry. curl -X POST -H \"Content-type: application/json; artifactType=AVRO\" \\ -H \"X-Registry-ArtifactId: share-price\" \\ (1) --data '{ \"type\":\"record\", \"name\":\"price\", \"namespace\":\"com.example\", \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"}, {\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]}' https://my-cluster-my-registry-my-project.example.com/apis/registry/v3/groups/my-group/artifacts -s (2) 1 Simple Avro schema artifact. 2 OpenShift route name that exposes Apicurio Registry. io.apicurio apicurio-registry-maven-plugin ${apicurio.version} generate-sources register (1) http://REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v3 (2) TestGroup (3) FullNameRecord ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/schemas/record.avsc FAIL TestGroup ExampleAPI (4) GRAPHQL ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/apis/example.graphql FIND_OR_CREATE_VERSION true 1 Specify register as the execution goal to upload the schema artifact to the registry. 2 Specify the Apicurio Registry URL with the ../apis/registry/v3 endpoint. 3 Specify the Apicurio Registry artifact group ID. 4 You can upload multiple artifacts using the specified group ID, artifact ID, and location.

You can access the Apicurio Registry Typescript SDK by adding the correct dependency to your application’s package.json file (assumes a node.js application): https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apicurio/apicurio-registry-sdk You can access the Apicurio Registry Python SDK by adding the correct dependency to your python project (assumes you are using pypi): https://pypi.org/project/apicurioregistrysdk/ You can access the Apicurio Registry Golang SDK by adding the correct dependency to your project: https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-registry/tree/main/go-sdk You can write a client application to manage artifacts stored in Apicurio Registry by using one of the Apicurio Registry SDKs. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment. You have created a Maven project for your Java client application. For more details, see Apache Maven. Procedure Add the following dependency to your Maven project: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-java-sdk ${apicurio-registry.version} Create the Apicurio Registry client as follows: import io.vertx.core.Vertx;public class ClientExample { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { // Create a registry client String registryUrl = \"https://my-registry.my-domain.com/apis/registry/v3\"; (1) Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx(); (2) VertXRequestAdapter vertXRequestAdapter = new VertXRequestAdapter(vertx); vertXRequestAdapter.setBaseUrl(REGISTRY_URL); RegistryClient client = new RegistryClient(vertXRequestAdapter); (3) // Use client here vertx.close(); (4) } } 1 If you specify an example Apicurio Registry URL of https://my-registry.my-domain.com, the client will automatically append /apis/registry/v3. 2 Create a new Vertx object (needed by the VertxRequestAdapter) 3 For more options when creating a Apicurio Registry client, see the Java client configuration in the next section. 4 When you are done with the client, close the Vertx object to free its resources. When the client is created, you can use all of the operations available in the Apicurio Registry REST API in the client. For more details, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. Additional resources For an open source example of how to use and customize the Apicurio Registry client, see the Apicurio Registry REST client demonstration. For details on how to use the Apicurio Registry Kafka client serializers/deserializers (SerDes) in producer and consumer applications, see Validating schemas using Kafka client serializers/deserializers in Java clients. The Apicurio Registry Java client includes the following configuration options, based on the client factory: Table 1. Apicurio Registry Java client configuration options Option Description Arguments Plain client Basic REST client used to interact with a running Apicurio Registry. baseUrl Client with custom configuration Apicurio Registry client using the configuration provided by the user. baseUrl, Map configs Client with custom configuration and authentication Apicurio Registry client that accepts a map containing custom configuration. For example, this is useful to add custom headers to the calls. You must also provide an authentication server to authenticate the requests. baseUrl, Map configs, Auth auth To configure custom headers, you must add the apicurio.registry.request.headers prefix to the configs map key. For example, a configs map key of apicurio.registry.request.headers.Authorization with a value of Basic: YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1 sets the Authorization header with the same value. You can configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication for the Apicurio Registry Java client using the following properties: apicurio.registry.request.ssl.truststore.location apicurio.registry.request.ssl.truststore.password apicurio.registry.request.ssl.truststore.type apicurio.registry.request.ssl.keystore.location apicurio.registry.request.ssl.keystore.password apicurio.registry.request.ssl.keystore.type apicurio.registry.request.ssl.key.password Additional resources For details on how to configure authentication for Apicurio Registry Kafka client serializers/deserializers (SerDes), see Validating schemas using Kafka client serializers/deserializers in Java clients.","title":"Managing Apicurio Registry content using a SDK","component":"apicurio-registry","version":"3.1.x","name":"assembly-using-the-registry-client","url":"/apicurio-registry/3.1.x/getting-started/assembly-using-the-registry-client.html","titles":[{"text":"Apicurio Registry SDK","id":"registry-sdk-intro_registry"},{"text":"Java","id":"_java"},{"text":"Typescript","id":"_typescript"},{"text":"Python","id":"_python"},{"text":"Golang","id":"_golang"},{"text":"Writing Apicurio Registry SDK applications","id":"writing-registry-sdk_registry"},{"text":"Using the Apicurio Registry Java SDK","id":"_using_the_apicurio_registry_java_sdk"},{"text":"Apicurio Registry Java SDK configuration","id":"registry-sdk-config_registry"},{"text":"Custom header configuration","id":"_custom_header_configuration"},{"text":"TLS configuration options","id":"_tls_configuration_options"}]},"/apicurio-registry/3.1.x/getting-started/guide-exporting-registry-kafka-topic-data.html":{"text":"One of the supported Apicurio Registry storage options is Apache Kafka, which uses a Kafka topic named kafkasql-journal to store data. If you encounter a problem when using this storage option and want to report it to Apicurio Registry developers, you might need to provide an export of the data present in the kafkasql-journal topic for analysis. This document contains information on how to create such a topic export using the kcat tool (formerly known as kafkacat). Prerequisites Kafka has been installed and is running in your environment. You have deployed Apicurio Registry with data stored in the kafkasql-journal topic. The kafkasql-journal topic is still present. Prerequisites Your environment is Kubernetes. You have logged in to the cluster using the kubectl command line interface. Procedure Select a namespace where an ephemeral work pod will be started. This can be the same or a different namespace from where the Kafka cluster is deployed: kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=default Create an ephemeral work pod using the latest Fedora image, and connect to the pod using your terminal: kubectl run work-pod -it --rm --image=fedora --restart=Never If you keep the --rm flag, the work pod will be deleted when you disconnect from the remote terminal. You can install kcat using the dnf package manager. However, that version does not have JSON support enabled. Because you want to export the topic data in a JSON format with additional metadata, you must build the kcat executable from source. In addition, while the kcat project is widely used for this use case, this project seems to be hibernated, and you require an additional feature for the kafkasql-journal topic export to work properly. This feature is support for base64 encoded keys and values, and is important because the topic includes raw binary data, which might not be correctly encoded in the JSON output.Therefore, you must build kcat from source that includes base64 support, which has not been merged into the main project yet. Install git, and check out the kcat repository: dnf install -y git git clone https://github.com/edenhill/kcat.git git remote add jjlin https://github.com/jjlin/kcat.git cd kcat git checkout jjlin/base64 Install the dependencies and build kcat: dnf install -y gcc librdkafka-devel yajl-devel ./configure make Copy the executable to /usr/bin so that it is available in $PATH: cp kcat /usr/bin Configure environment variables that will be used in subsequent examples: export KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=\"my-kafka-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.default.svc:9092\" If you do not require JSON support, you can use the following commands to install kcat using dnf: dnf install -y \"dnf-command(copr)\" dnf copr enable bvn13/kcat dnf update dnf install -y kafkacat The following are several examples of how to use kcat, including creation of a topic export: List Kafka topics: kcat -b $KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER -L | grep \"topic \" | sed 's#\\([^\"]*\"\\)\\([^\"]*\\)\\(\".*\\)#\\2#' The sed command filters out extra information in this example. Export data from the kafkasql-journal topic in JSON format, with envelope, and base64 encoded keys and values: kcat -b $KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER -C -t kafkasql-journal -S base64 -Z -D \\\\n -e -J \\ > kafkasql-journal.topicdump Create an export file for each listed topic by combining the preceding commands: mkdir dump for t in $(kcat -b $KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER -L | grep \"topic \" | sed 's#\\([^\"]*\"\\)\\([^\"]*\\)\\(\".*\\)#\\2#'); do \\ kcat -b $KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER -C -t $t -S base64 -Z -D \\\\n -e -J > dump/$t.topicdump; \\ done After the topic export files have been created, you can run the following command on your local machine to copy the files from the work pod: kubectl cp work-pod:/kcat/dump . To import kafkasql-journal topic data that has been created with kcat, use an application from the Apicurio Registry examples repository as follows: git clone https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-registry.git cd examples/tools/kafkasql-topic-import mvn clean install export VERSION=$(mvn help:evaluate -Dexpression=project.version -q -DforceStdout) java -jar target/apicurio-registry-tools-kafkasql-topic-import-$VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar -b -f Additional resources For more details about kcat, see the kcat repository.

If you are deploying to Kubernetes, you can use command line tools to install Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), and instruct it to deploy the Apicurio Registry or other Operators. Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to a Kubernetes cluster. Procedure Go to OperatorHub.io - Apicurio Registry page. Select the Version you want to install Read the information about the Operator, and click Install. Follow the instructions on the installation page. The recommended way to install Apicurio Registry Operator is to use the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which can automatically manage the Operator deployment and upgrades. Apicurio Registry Operator is released to the OperatorHub, so if your cluster has the OLM and OperatorHub installed, the cluster administrator can use the OpenShift web console to deploy the Apicurio Registry Operator: Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to an OpenShift cluster. Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Create a new OpenShift project: In the left navigation menu, click Home > Project > Create Project. Enter a project name, for example, my-project, and click Create. In the left navigation menu, click Operators > OperatorHub. In the Filter by keyword text box, enter registry to find the Apicurio Registry Operator. Read the information about the Operator, and click Install. This displays the Create Operator Subscription page. Select your subscription settings, for example: Installation Mode > A specific namespace on the cluster > my-project Update Channel > 2.x Approval Strategy > Automatic Click Subscribe. This displays the Operators > Installed Operators page. Wait a few moments until the Status for the Apicurio Registry Operator displays Succeeded and the subscription is Up to Date. Additional resources Adding Operators to an OpenShift cluster The recommended Kafka storage option requires that you provide connection information to a Kafka cluster. You can use any Kafka cluster with Kafka support. However, it is recommended to use the Strimzi Operator to provide and maintain a Kafka cluster for you. If you do not already have Kafka installed, you can install the Strimzi Operator on your OpenShift cluster from the OperatorHub. Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to an OpenShift cluster Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Change to the OpenShift project in which Apicurio Registry is installed. For example, from the Project drop-down, select my-project. In the left navigation menu, click Operators > OperatorHub. In the Filter by keyword text box, enter Strimzi to find the Strimzi Operator. Read the information about the Operator, and click Install. This displays the Create Operator Subscription page. Select your subscription settings, for example: Installation Mode > A specific namespace on the cluster > my-project Update Channel > stable Approval Strategy > Manual Click Subscribe. This displays the Operators > Installed Operators page. Wait a few moments until the Status for the Strimzi Operator displays Succeeded and the subscription is Up to Date. Additional resources Adding Operators to an OpenShift cluster Using AMQ Streams on OpenShift One of the available storage options requires that you provide connection information to a PostgreSQL database. You can use any PostgreSQL database available on your OpenShift cluster, but it is recommended to use OperatorHub to choose and install an Operator that can manage a PostgreSQL database for you. You can install your preferred PostgresQL Operator, but this section shows how to install the PostgreSQL Operator by Dev4Ddevs.com and create a new database for Apicurio Registry. Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to an OpenShift cluster. Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Change to the OpenShift project in which Apicurio Registry is installed. For example, from the Project drop-down, select my-project. In the left navigation menu, click Operators > OperatorHub. In the Filter by keyword text box, enter PostgreSQL to find an Operator suitable for your environment, for example, PostgreSQL Operator by Dev4Ddevs.com or Crunchy PostgreSQL for OpenShift. Read the information about the Operator, and click Install. This displays the Create Operator Subscription page. Select your subscription settings, for example: Installation Mode: Select one of the following: All namespaces on the cluster (default) A specific namespace on the cluster and then my-project Update Channel > stable Approval Strategy: Select Automatic or Manual Click Subscribe. This displays the Operators > Installed Operators page. Wait a few moments until the Status for the PostgreSQL Operator displays Succeeded and the subscription is Up to Date. You must read the documentation from your chosen PostgreSQL Operator for details on how to create and manage your database. Create a PostgreSQL database for your Apicurio Registry storage. For example, click Installed Operators > PostgreSQL Operator by Dev4Ddevs.com > Create database > YAML.

On the main overview page, view the managedResources section, which contains the name of the Deployment managed by the Operator to deploy your Apicurio Registry instance. Find that Deployment in the Workloads > Deployments in the left menu. Select the Deployment with the correct name, and select the Environment tab. You can add or modify your environment variable to the Single values (env) section. Click Save at the bottom. OpenShift CLI Select the project where Apicurio Registry is installed. Run oc get apicurioregistry to get the list of ApicurioRegistry CRs Run oc describe on the CR representing the Apicurio Registry instance that you want to configure. View the managedResource in the status section. Find that Deployment and enter oc edit. Add or modify the environment variable in the spec.template.spec.containers[0].env section. Apicurio Registry provides readiness and liveness probes for OpenShift to ensure application health. These settings are configured to use reasonable defaults, but if you want to adjust them, this section provides details on the environment variables that you can configure. OpenShift liveness and readiness errors are explained as follows: Liveness error - the application cannot make progress, OpenShift restarts the failing pod. Readiness error - the application is not ready, for example, it is overwhelmed by requests. OpenShift stops sending requests to the pod for the time the probe fails. If other pods are OK, they still receive requests. Table 2. Apicurio Registry liveness environment variables Name Value type Description LIVENESS_ERROR_THRESHOLD Positive integer Number of liveness errors that can occur before the liveness probe fails. LIVENESS_COUNTER_RESET Positive integer, seconds Period in which the threshold number of errors must occur. For example, if this value is 60 and the threshold is 1, the check fails after two errors occur in 1 minute. LIVENESS_STATUS_RESET Positive integer, seconds Number of seconds that must elapse without any more errors for the liveness probe to reset to OK status. Because OpenShift restarts the pod that fails the liveness check, this value, unlike readiness, does not actually affect what happens. LIVENESS_ERRORS_IGNORED Comma-separated list of fully qualified exception class names. List of errors that are ignored for liveness checking purposes. Table 3. Apicurio Registry readiness environment variables Name Value type Description READINESS_ERROR_THRESHOLD Positive integer Number of readiness errors that can occur before the readiness probe fails. READINESS_COUNTER_RESET Positive integer, seconds Period in which the threshold number of errors must occur. For example, if this value is 60 and the threshold is 1, the check fails after two errors occur in 1 minute. READINESS_STATUS_RESET Positive integer, seconds Number of seconds that must elapse without any more errors for the readiness probe to reset to OK status. In practice, this value means how long the pod remains in an unready state until it returns to normal operation. READINESS_TIMEOUT positive integer, seconds The readiness system tracks the timeout of two operations: how long it takes for a storage request to complete, and how long it takes for an HTTP REST API request to return a response. If the operation takes more time, it is counted as a readiness error. This value controls those timeouts. The following procedure shows how to configure Apicurio Registry deployment to expose a port for HTTPS connections from inside the OpenShift cluster. This kind of connection is not directly available outside of the cluster. Routing is based on hostname, which is encoded in the case of an HTTPS connection. Therefore, edge termination or other configuration is still needed. See Configuring an HTTPS connection to Apicurio Registry from outside the OpenShift cluster. Prerequisites You must have already installed the Apicurio Registry Operator. Procedure Generate a keystore with a self-signed certificate. You can skip this step if you are using your own certificates. keytool -genkey -trustcacerts -keyalg RSA -keystore registry-keystore.jks -storepass password Create a new secret to hold the keystore and keystore password. In the left navigation menu of the OpenShift web console, click Workloads > Secrets > Create Key/Value Secret. Use the following values: Name: registry-keystore Key 1: keystore.jks Value 1: registry-keystore.jks (uploaded file) Key 2: password Value 2: password If you encounter a java.io.IOException: Invalid keystore format, the upload of the binary file did not work properly. As an alternative, encode the file as a base64 string using cat registry-keystore.jks | base64 -w0 > data.txt and edit the Secret resource as yaml to manually add the encoded file. Edit the Deployment resource of the Apicurio Registry instance. You can find the correct name in a status field of the Apicurio Registry Operator. Add the keystore secret as a volume: template: spec: volumes: - name: registry-keystore-secret-volume secret: secretName: registry-keystore Add a volume mount: volumeMounts: - name: registry-keystore-secret-volume mountPath: /etc/registry-keystore readOnly: true Add JAVA_OPTIONS and KEYSTORE_PASSWORD environment variables: - name: KEYSTORE_PASSWORD valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: registry-keystore key: password - name: JAVA_OPTIONS value: >- -Dquarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-file=/etc/registry-keystore/keystore.jks -Dquarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-file-type=jks -Dquarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-password=$(KEYSTORE_PASSWORD) Order is important when using string interpolation. Enable the HTTPS port: ports: - containerPort: 8080 protocol: TCP - containerPort: 8443 protocol: TCP Edit the Service resource of the Apicurio Registry instance. You can find the correct name in a status field of the Apicurio Registry Operator. ports: - name: http protocol: TCP port: 8080 targetPort: 8080 - name: https protocol: TCP port: 8443 targetPort: 8443 Verify that the connection is working: Connect into a pod on the cluster using SSH (you can use the Apicurio Registry pod): oc rsh -n default example-apicurioregistry-deployment-vx28s-4-lmtqb Find the cluster IP of the Apicurio Registry pod from the Service resource (see the Location column in the web console). Afterwards, execute a test request (we are using self-signed certificate, so an insecure flag is required): curl -k https://172.30.209.198:8443/health [...] The following procedure shows how to configure Apicurio Registry deployment to expose an HTTPS edge-terminated route for connections from outside the OpenShift cluster. Prerequisites You must have already installed the Apicurio Registry Operator. Read the OpenShift documentation for creating secured routes. Procedure Add a second Route in addition to the HTTP route created by the Apicurio Registry Operator. See the following example: kind: Route apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1 metadata: [...] labels: app: example-apicurioregistry [...] spec: host: example-apicurioregistry-default.apps.example.com to: kind: Service name: example-apicurioregistry-service-9whd7 weight: 100 port: targetPort: 8080 tls: termination: edge insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect wildcardPolicy: None Make sure the insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect configuration property is set. If you do not specify a certificate, OpenShift will use a default. You can alternatively generate a custom self-signed certificate using the following commands: openssl genrsa 2048 > host.key && openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -key host.key -out host.cert and then create a route using the OpenShift CLI: oc create route edge \\ --service=example-apicurioregistry-service-9whd7 \\ --cert=host.cert --key=host.key \\ --hostname=example-apicurioregistry-default.apps.example.com \\ --insecure-policy=Redirect \\ -n default When using storage in a PostgreSQL database, you must ensure that the data stored by Apicurio Registry is backed up regularly. SQL Dump is a simple procedure that works with any PostgreSQL installation. This uses the pg_dump utility to generate a file with SQL commands that you can use to recreate the database in the same state that it was in at the time of the dump. pg_dump is a regular PostgreSQL client application, which you can execute from any remote host that has access to the database. Like any other client, the operations that can perform are limited to the user permissions. Procedure Use the pg_dump command to redirect the output to a file: $ pg_dump dbname > dumpfile You can specify the database server that pg_dump connects to using the -h host and -p port options. You can reduce large dump files using a compression tool, such as gzip, for example: $ pg_dump dbname | gzip > filename.gz Additional resources For details on client authentication, see the PostgreSQL documentation. For details on importing and exporting registry content, see Managing Apicurio Registry content using the REST API. You can restore SQL Dump files created by pg_dump using the psql utility. Prerequisites You must have already backed up your PostgreSQL datbase using pg_dump. See Backing up Apicurio Registry PostgreSQL storage. All users who own objects or have permissions on objects in the dumped database must already exist. Procedure Enter the following command to create the database: $ createdb -T template0 dbname Enter the following command to restore the SQL dump $ psql dbname < dumpfile Run ANALYZE on each database so the query optimizer has useful statistics.","title":"Configuring and managing Apicurio Registry deployment","component":"apicurio-registry-operator","version":"1.0.0","name":"assembly-registry-maintenance","url":"/apicurio-registry-operator/1.0.0/assembly-registry-maintenance.html","titles":[{"text":"Securing Apicurio Registry using the Keycloak Operator","id":"registry-security-keycloak"},{"text":"Managing Apicurio Registry environment variables","id":"manage-registry-environment-variables"},{"text":"Apicurio Registry liveness and readiness environment variables","id":"registry-liveness-and-readiness"},{"text":"Configuring an HTTPS connection to Apicurio Registry from inside the OpenShift cluster","id":"registry-https-in-cluster"},{"text":"Configuring an HTTPS connection to Apicurio Registry from outside the OpenShift cluster","id":"registry-https-outside-cluster"},{"text":"Backing up Apicurio Registry PostgreSQL storage","id":"registry-sql-backup"},{"text":"Restoring Apicurio Registry PostgreSQL storage","id":"registry-sql-restore"}]},"/apicurio-registry-operator/1.0.0/assembly-registry-storage.html":{"text":"This chapter explains how to configure the available Apicurio Registry storage options: Apicurio Registry storage options Configuring Apicurio Registry In-Memory storage using CLI Configuring plain Kafka storage with no security Configuring Kafka storage with TLS security Configuring Kafka storage with SCRAM security Configuring SQL (PostgreSQL) storage This chapter mostly focuses on storage configuration procedures for OpenShift using OperatorHub UI. If you are deploying to Kubernetes, you can use command line tools to perform the equivalent steps. The Apicurio Registry Operator supports the same configuration options on OpenShift and Kubernetes. The main decision to make when deploying Apicurio Registry is which storage backend to use. The following storage options are available: In-memory - data is stored in RAM on each Apicurio Registry node. This is the easiest deployment to use, but is not recommended for production environment. Apache Kafka (Kafka + SQL) - data is stored using Apache Kafka, with the help of local SQL database on each node. SQL (PostgreSQL) - data is stored in a relational database, in this case PostgreSQL 12+. Storage requiring installation The following options require that the storage is already installed as a prerequisite: Apache Kafka SQL (PostgreSQL) Additional resources Installing Apicurio Registry Operator using the OperatorHub The in-memory storage option uses RAM to store the data on nodes where Apicurio Registry is deployed, and it is the simplest persistence option to use. The Apicurio Registry Operator will deploy Apicurio Registry in this way if you do not provide any configuration in the ApicurioRegistry CR: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry metadata: name: example-apicurioregistry-mem spec: configuration: persistence: \"mem\" # Optional (default value) # NOTE: No additional configuration required for *dev* deployment Prerequisites You must have an Kubernetes cluster with cluster administrator access. You must have already installed the Apicurio Registry Operator. Procedure Deploy the example CR using following commands: export NAMESPACE=\"default\" curl -sSL \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apicurio/apicurio-registry-operator/v1.0.0/docs/modules/ROOT/examples/apicurioregistry_mem_cr.yaml\" | kubectl apply -f - -n $NAMESPACE This persistence option does not support data distribution across Apicurio Registry nodes. Therefore, it is only recommended for development environments using a single replica (Pod). Use embedded Infinispan persistence option when deploying multiple replicas. You can configure the Strimzi Operator and Apicurio Registry Operator to use a default connection with no security. Prerequisites You must install the Apicurio Registry Operator using the OperatorHub or command line. You must install the Strimzi Operator or have Kafka accessible from your OpenShift cluster. Procedure In the OpenShift web console, click Installed Operators, select the Strimzi Operator details, and then the Kafka tab. Click Create Kafka to provision a new Kafka cluster for Apicurio Registry storage. You can use the default value, for example: apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2 kind: Kafka metadata: name: my-cluster namespace: registry-example-kafkasql-plain # Change or remove the explicit namespace spec: kafka: config: offsets.topic.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.min.isr: 2 log.message.format.version: '2.7' inter.broker.protocol.version: '2.7' version: 2.7.0 storage: type: ephemeral replicas: 3 listeners: - name: plain port: 9092 type: internal tls: false - name: tls port: 9093 type: internal tls: true entityOperator: topicOperator: {} userOperator: {} zookeeper: storage: type: ephemeral replicas: 3 Your OpenShift project namespace might be different. When the cluster is ready, open the Kafka resource, examine the status block, and copy the bootstrapServers value for later use when deploying Apicurio Registry. For example: status: conditions: ... listeners: - addresses: - host: my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.registry-example-kafkasql-plain.svc port: 9092 bootstrapServers: 'my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.registry-example-kafkasql-plain.svc:9092' type: plain ... The default Kafka topic name that Apicurio Registry uses to store data is kafkasql-journal. This topic is created automatically by Apicurio Registry. You can override this behavior or the default topic name by setting the appropriate environment variables (default values): REGISTRY_KAFKASQL_TOPIC_AUTO_CREATE=true REGISTRY_KAFKASQL_TOPIC=kafkasql-journal If you decide not to create the Kafka topic manually, skip the next step. Click the Kafka Topic tab, and then Create Kafka Topic to create the kafkasql-journal topic: apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1 kind: KafkaTopic metadata: name: kafkasql-journal labels: strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster namespace: registry-example-kafkasql-plain spec: partitions: 2 replicas: 1 config: retention.ms: 604800000 segment.bytes: 1073741824 Select the Apicurio Registry Operator, and in the ApicurioRegistry tab, click Create ApicurioRegistry, using the following example, but replace your value in the bootstrapServers field. apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry metadata: name: example-apicurioregistry-kafkasql spec: configuration: persistence: \"kafkasql\" kafkasql: bootstrapServers: \"my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.registry-example-kafkasql-plain.svc:9092\" Wait a few minutes to see the Route being created, where you can access the application. You can configure the Strimzi Operator and Apicurio Registry Operator to use an encrypted Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection. Prerequisites You must install the Apicurio Registry Operator using the OperatorHub or command line. You must install the Strimzi Operator or have Kafka accessible from your OpenShift cluster. This section assumes that the Strimzi Operator is available, however you can use any Kafka deployment. In that case, you must manually create the Openshift secrets that the Apicurio Registry Operator expects. Procedure In the OpenShift web console, click Installed Operators, select the Strimzi Operator details, and then the Kafka tab. Click Create Kafka to provision a new Kafka cluster for Apicurio Registry storage. Configure the authorization and tls fields to use TLS authentication for the Kafka cluster, for example: apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2 kind: Kafka metadata: name: my-cluster namespace: registry-example-kafkasql-tls # Change or remove the explicit namespace spec: kafka: config: offsets.topic.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.min.isr: 2 log.message.format.version: '2.7' inter.broker.protocol.version: '2.7' version: 2.7.0 storage: type: ephemeral replicas: 3 listeners: - name: tls port: 9093 type: internal tls: true authentication: type: tls authorization: type: simple entityOperator: topicOperator: {} userOperator: {} zookeeper: storage: type: ephemeral replicas: 3 The default Kafka topic name that Apicurio Registry uses to store data is kafkasql-journal.

You can specify a user name in the metadata section or use the default my-user. apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1 kind: KafkaUser metadata: name: my-user labels: strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster namespace: registry-example-kafkasql-tls spec: authentication: type: tls authorization: acls: - operation: All resource: name: '*' patternType: literal type: topic - operation: All resource: name: '*' patternType: literal type: cluster - operation: All resource: name: '*' patternType: literal type: transactionalId - operation: All resource: name: '*' patternType: literal type: group type: simple You must configure the authorization specifically for the topics and resources that the Apicurio Registry requires. This is a simple permissive example. Click Workloads and then Secrets to find two secrets that Strimzi creates for Apicurio Registry to connect to the Kafka cluster: my-cluster-cluster-ca-cert - contains the PKCS12 truststore for the Kafka cluster my-user - contains the user’s keystore The name of the secret can vary based on your cluster or user name. If you create the secrets manually, they must contain the following key-value pairs: my-cluster-ca-cert ca.p12 - truststore in PKCS12 format ca.password - truststore password my-user user.p12 - keystore in PKCS12 format user.password - keystore password Configure the following example configuration to deploy the Apicurio Registry. apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry metadata: name: example-apicurioregistry-kafkasql spec: configuration: persistence: \"kafkasql\" kafkasql: bootstrapServers: \"my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.registry-example-kafkasql-tls.svc:9093\" security: tls: keystoreSecretName: my-user truststoreSecretName: my-cluster-cluster-ca-cert You must use a different bootstrapServers address than in the plain insecure use case. The address must support TLS connections and is found in the specified Kafka resource under the type: tls field. You can configure the Strimzi Operator and Apicurio Registry Operator to use Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM-SHA-512) for the Kafka cluster. Prerequisites You must install the Apicurio Registry Operator using the OperatorHub or command line. You must install the Strimzi Operator or have Kafka accessible from your OpenShift cluster.
