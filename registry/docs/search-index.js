to the Apicurio Registry version 2.5 documentation. Navigate using the left menu. Apicurio Registry is a schema registry and an API registry, which stores and retrieves event schemas and API designs, and gives you control of their evolution. This document introduces Apicurio Registry, explains how to install with your chosen storage option, and how to manage event schemas and API designs using the Apicurio Registry web console, REST API, Maven plug-in, or Java client. This document also explains how to enforce schemas using Kafka client serializers and deserializers in your consumer and producer applications. It also describes Apicurio Registry content types and rule types, and OpenShift environment variables for health checks. See the Apicurio Registry and Apicurio Registry Operator projects on GitHub.

Apicurio Registry artifact types Apicurio Registry artifact states Apicurio Registry artifact metadata Additional resources For more information, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. You can store and manage a wide range of schema and API artifact types in Apicurio Registry. Table 1. Apicurio Registry artifact types Type Description ASYNCAPI AsyncAPI specification AVRO Apache Avro schema GRAPHQL GraphQL schema JSON JSON Schema KCONNECT Apache Kafka Connect schema OPENAPI OpenAPI specification PROTOBUF Google protocol buffers schema WSDL Web Services Definition Language XML Extensible Markup Language XSD XML Schema Definition The valid artifact states in Apicurio Registry are ENABLED, DISABLED, and DEPRECATED. Table 2. Apicurio Registry artifact states State Description ENABLED Basic state, all the operations are available. DISABLED The artifact and its metadata is viewable and searchable using the Apicurio Registry web console, but its content cannot be fetched by any client. DEPRECATED The artifact is fully usable but a header is added to the REST API response whenever the artifact content is fetched. The Apicurio Registry Rest Client will also log a warning whenever it sees deprecated content. When an artifact is added to Apicurio Registry, a set of metadata properties is created and stored along with the artifact content. This metadata consists of system-generated or user-generated properties that are read-only, and editable properties that you can update after the artifact is created. Table 3. Apicurio Registry system-generated metadata Property Type Description contentId integer Unique identifier of artifact content in Apicurio Registry. The same content ID can be shared by multiple artifact versions when artifact versions have identical content. For example, a content ID of 4 can be used by multiple artifact versions with the same content. createdBy string The name of the user who created the artifact. createdOn date The date and time when the artifact was created, for example, 2023-10-11T14:15:28Z. globalId integer Globally unique identifier of an artifact version in Apicurio Registry. For example, a global ID of 1 is assigned to the first artifact version created in Apicurio Registry. modifiedBy string The name of the user who modified the artifact. modifiedOn date The date and time at which the artifact was modified, for example, 2023-10-11T14:15:28Z. type ArtifactType The supported artifact type, for example, AVRO, OPENAPI, or PROTOBUF. Table 4. Apicurio Registry user-provided or system-generated metadata Property Type Description groupId string Unique identifier of an artifact group in Apicurio Registry, for example, development or production. When creating an artifact by using the Apicurio Registry web console, if you do not provide a group ID, this is set to default. You must provide a group ID when using the Apicurio Registry REST API, Java client, or Maven plug-in. id string Unique identifier of an artifact in Apicurio Registry. You can provide an artifact ID or use the UUID generated by Apicurio Registry, for example, 8d168cad-1865-4e6c-bb7e-04e8be005bea. Different versions of an artifact use the same artifact ID, but have different global IDs. references array of ArtifactReference Optional set of artifact references contained in the artifact, which you can provide when creating the artifact. The following simple example shows a single artifact reference: [{\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"artifactId\":\"ItemId\",\"version\":\"1\",\"name\":\"com.example.common.ItemId\"}]. version integer The latest version of the artifact. You can use the generated version, for example, 3, or provide a version by using the Apicurio Registry REST API or Maven plug-in, for example, 2.1.6. Table 5. Apicurio Registry editable metadata Property Type Description description string Optional meaningful description of the artifact, for example, This is a simple OpenAPI for testing. You can provide a description, or it can be automatically discovered from the info section of OpenAPI and AsyncAPI artifacts, if already provided. labels array of string Optional comma-separated list of labels used to filter and search for the artifact, for example, test,protobuf. Provided by the user. name string Optional human-readable name of the artifact, for example, My first Avro schema. You can provide a description, or it can be automatically discovered from the info section of OpenAPI and AsyncAPI artifacts, if the title field has a value. properties map Optional list of user-defined name-value pairs associated with the artifact. The name and value must be strings, for example, my-key and my-value. state ArtifactState The latest state of the artifact: ENABLED, DISABLED, or DEPRECATED. Defaults to ENABLED. Updating artifact metadata You can use the Apicurio Registry REST API or web console to update the set of editable metadata properties. You can update the state property only by using the Apicurio Registry REST API.

You can configure application properties as Java system properties or include them in the Quarkus application.properties file. For more details, see the Quarkus documentation. When using schemas in your Kafka client applications, you must choose which specific schema type to use, depending on your use case. Apicurio Registry provides SerDe Java classes for Apache Avro, JSON Schema, and Google Protobuf. The following sections explain how to configure Kafka applications to use each type. You can also use Kafka to implement custom serializer and deserializer classes, and leverage Apicurio Registry functionality using the Apicurio Registry REST Java client. Using the SerDe classes provided by Apicurio Registry in your Kafka application involves setting the correct configuration properties. The following simple Avro examples show how to configure a serializer in a Kafka producer application and how to configure a deserializer in a Kafka consumer application. Example serializer configuration in a Kafka producer // Create the Kafka producer private static Producer createKafkaProducer() { Properties props = new Properties(); // Configure standard Kafka settings props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, SERVERS); props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.CLIENT_ID_CONFIG, \"Producer-\" + TOPIC_NAME); props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.ACKS_CONFIG, \"all\"); // Use Apicurio Registry-provided Kafka serializer for Avro props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName()); props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, AvroKafkaSerializer.class.getName()); // Configure the Apicurio Registry location props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.REGISTRY_URL, REGISTRY_URL); // Register the schema artifact if not found in the registry. props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.AUTO_REGISTER_ARTIFACT, Boolean.TRUE); // Create the Kafka producer Producer producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props); return producer; } Example deserializer configuration in a Kafka consumer // Create the Kafka consumer private static KafkaConsumer createKafkaConsumer() { Properties props = new Properties(); // Configure standard Kafka settings props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, SERVERS); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, \"Consumer-\" + TOPIC_NAME); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG, \"true\"); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_COMMIT_INTERVAL_MS_CONFIG, \"1000\"); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, \"earliest\"); // Use Apicurio Registry-provided Kafka deserializer for Avro props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName()); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, AvroKafkaDeserializer.class.getName()); // Configure the Apicurio Registry location props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.REGISTRY_URL, REGISTRY_URL); // No other configuration needed because the schema globalId the deserializer uses is sent // in the payload. The deserializer extracts the globalId and uses it to look up the schema // from the registry. // Create the Kafka consumer KafkaConsumer consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props); return consumer; } Additional resources For an example application, see the Simple Avro example This topic explains how to use the Kafka client serializer and deserializer (SerDes) classes for Apache Avro. Apicurio Registry provides the following Kafka client SerDes classes for Avro: io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro.AvroKafkaSerializer io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro.AvroKafkaDeserializer Configure the Avro serializer You can configure the Avro serializer class with the following: Apicurio Registry URL Artifact resolver strategy ID location ID encoding Avro datum provider Avro encoding ID location The serializer passes the unique ID of the schema as part of the Kafka message so that consumers can use the correct schema for deserialization. The ID can be in the message payload or in the message headers. The default location is the message payload. To send the ID in the message headers, set the following configuration property: props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.ENABLE_HEADERS, \"true\") The property name is apicurio.registry.headers.enabled. ID encoding You can customize how the schema ID is encoded when passing it in the Kafka message body. Set the apicurio.registry.id-handler configuration property to a class that implements the io.apicurio.registry.serde.IdHandler interface. Apicurio Registry provides the following implementations: io.apicurio.registry.serde.DefaultIdHandler: Stores the ID as an 8-byte long io.apicurio.registry.serde.Legacy4ByteIdHandler: Stores the ID as an 4-byte integer Apicurio Registry represents the schema ID as a long, but for legacy reasons, or for compatibility with other registries or SerDe classes, you might want to use 4 bytes when sending the ID. Avro datum provider Avro provides different datum writers and readers to write and read data. Apicurio Registry supports three different types: Generic Specific Reflect The Apicurio Registry AvroDatumProvider is the abstraction of which type is used, where DefaultAvroDatumProvider is used by default. You can set the following configuration options: apicurio.registry.avro-datum-provider: Specifies a fully-qualified Java class name of the AvroDatumProvider implementation, for example io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro.ReflectAvroDatumProvider apicurio.registry.use-specific-avro-reader: Set to true to use a specific type when using DefaultAvroDatumProvider Avro encoding When using Avro to serialize data, you can use the Avro binary encoding format to ensure the data is encoded in as efficient a format as possible. Avro also supports encoding the data as JSON, which makes it easier to inspect the payload of each message, for example, for logging or debugging. You can set the Avro encoding by configuring the apicurio.registry.avro.encoding property with a value of JSON or BINARY. The default is BINARY. Configure the Avro deserializer You must configure the Avro deserializer class to match the following configuration settings of the serializer: Apicurio Registry URL ID encoding Avro datum provider Avro encoding See the serializer section for these configuration options. The property names and values are the same. The following options are not required when configuring the deserializer: Artifact resolver strategy ID location The deserializer class can determine the values for these options from the message. The strategy is not required because the serializer is responsible for sending the ID as part of the message. The ID location is determined by checking for the magic byte at the start of the message payload. If that byte is found, the ID is read from the message payload using the configured handler. If the magic byte is not found, the ID is read from the message headers. Avro SerDes and artifact references When working with Avro messages and a schema with nested records, a new artifact is registered per nested record. For example, the following TradeKey schema includes a nested Exchange schema: TradeKey schema with nested Exchange schema { \"namespace\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.trade\", \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"TradeKey\", \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"exchange\", \"type\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.common.Exchange\" }, { \"name\": \"key\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } Exchange schema { \"namespace\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.common\", \"type\": \"enum\", \"name\": \"Exchange\", \"symbols\" : [\"GEMINI\"] } When using these schemas with Avro SerDes, two artifacts are created in Apicurio Registry, one for the TradeKey schema and one for the Exchange schema. Whenever a message using the TradeKey schema is serialized or deserialized, both schemas are retrieved, allowing you to split your definitions into different files. Additional resources For more details on Avro configuration, see the AvroKafkaSerdeConfig Java class For Java example applications, see: Simple Avro example SerDes with references example This topic explains how to use the Kafka client serializer and deserializer (SerDes) classes for JSON Schema. Apicurio Registry provides the following Kafka client SerDes classes for JSON Schema: io.apicurio.registry.serde.jsonschema.JsonSchemaKafkaSerializer io.apicurio.registry.serde.jsonschema.JsonSchemaKafkaDeserializer Unlike Apache Avro, JSON Schema is not a serialization technology, but is instead a validation technology. As a result, configuration options for JSON Schema are quite different. For example, there is no encoding option, because data is always encoded as JSON. Configure the JSON Schema serializer You can configure the JSON Schema serializer class as follows: Apicurio Registry URL Artifact resolver strategy Schema validation The only non-standard configuration property is JSON Schema validation, which is enabled by default. You can disable this by setting apicurio.registry.serde.validation-enabled to \"false\". For example: props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.VALIDATION_ENABLED, Boolean.FALSE) Configure the JSON Schema deserializer You can configure the JSON Schema deserializer class as follows: Apicurio Registry URL Schema validation Class for deserializing data You must provide the location of Apicurio Registry so that the schema can be loaded. The other configuration is optional. Deserializer validation only works if the serializer passes the global ID in the Kafka message, which will only happen when validation is enabled in the serializer. JSON Schema SerDes and artifact references The JSON Schema SerDes cannot discover the schema from the message payload, so the schema artifact must be registered beforehand, and this also applies artifact references. Depending on the content of the schema, if the $ref value is a URL, the SerDes try to resolve the referenced schema using that URL, and then validation works as usual, validating the data against the main schema, and validating the nested value against the nested schema. Support for referencing artifacts in Apicurio Registry has also been implemented. For example, the following citizen.json schema references the city.json schema: citizen.json schema with reference to city.json schema { \"$id\": \"https://example.com/citizen.schema.json\", \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\", \"title\": \"Citizen\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"firstName\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The citizen's first name.\" }, \"lastName\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The citizen's last name.\" }, \"age\": { \"description\": \"Age in years which must be equal to or greater than zero.\", \"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0 }, \"city\": { \"$ref\": \"city.json\" } } } city.json schema { \"$id\": \"https://example.com/city.schema.json\", \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\", \"title\": \"City\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The city's name.\" }, \"zipCode\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"The zip code.\", \"minimum\": 0 } } } In this example, a given citizen has a city. In Apicurio Registry, a citizen artifact with a reference to the city artifact is created using the name city.json. In the SerDes, when the citizen schema is fetched, the city schema is also fetched because it is referenced from the citizen schema. When serializing/deserializing data, the reference name is used to resolve the nested schema, allowing validation against the citizen schema and the nested city schema. Additional resources For more details, see the JsonSchemaKafkaDeserializerConfig Java class For Java example applications, see: Simple JSON Schema example SerDes with references example This topic explains how to use the Kafka client serializer and deserializer (SerDes) classes for Google Protobuf. Apicurio Registry provides the following Kafka client SerDes classes for Protobuf: io.apicurio.registry.serde.protobuf.ProtobufKafkaSerializer io.apicurio.registry.serde.protobuf.ProtobufKafkaDeserializer Configure the Protobuf serializer You can configure the Protobuf serializer class as follows: Apicurio Registry URL Artifact resolver strategy ID location ID encoding Schema validation For details on these configuration options, see the following sections: Apicurio Registry serializer/deserializer configuration in client applications Configure Avro SerDes with Apicurio Registry Configure the Protobuf deserializer You must configure the Protobuf deserializer class to match the following configuration settings in the serializer: Apicurio Registry URL ID encoding The configuration property names and values are the same as for the serializer. The following options are not required when configuring the deserializer: Artifact resolver strategy ID location The deserializer class can determine the values for these options from the message. The strategy is not required because the serializer is responsible for sending the ID as part of the message. The ID location is determined by checking for the magic byte at the start of the message payload. If that byte is found, the ID is read from the message payload using the configured handler. If the magic byte is not found, the ID is read from the message headers. The Protobuf deserializer does not deserialize to your exact Protobuf Message implementation, but rather to a DynamicMessage instance. There is no appropriate API to do otherwise. Protobuf SerDes and artifact references When a complex Protobuf message with an import statement is used, the imported Protobuf messages are stored in Apicurio Registry as separate artifacts. Then when Apicurio Registry gets the main schema to check a Protobuf message, the referenced schemes are also retrieved so the full message schema can be checked and serialized. For example, the following table_info.proto schema file includes the imported mode.proto schema file: table_info.proto file with imported mode.proto file syntax = \"proto3\"; package sample; option java_package = \"io.api.sample\"; option java_multiple_files = true; import \"sample/mode.proto\"; message TableInfo { int32 winIndex = 1; Mode mode = 2; int32 min = 3; int32 max = 4; string id = 5; string dataAdapter = 6; string schema = 7; string selector = 8; string subscription_id = 9; } mode.proto file syntax = \"proto3\"; package sample; option java_package = \"io.api.sample\"; option java_multiple_files = true; enum Mode { MODE_UNKNOWN = 0; RAW = 1; MERGE = 2; DISTINCT = 3; COMMAND = 4; } In this example, two Protobuf artifacts are stored in Apicurio Registry, one for TableInfo and one for Mode. However, because Mode is part of TableInfo, whenever TableInfo is fetched to check a message in the SerDes, Mode is also returned as an artifact referenced by TableInfo.

This section explains how to manually configure authentication and authorization options for Apicurio Registry and Keycloak. Alternatively, for details on how to configure these settings automatically, see the Apicurio Registry Operator documentation. The Apicurio Registry web console and core REST API support authentication in Keycloak based on OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC). The same Keycloak realm and users are federated across the Apicurio Registry web console and core REST API using OpenID Connect so that you only require one set of credentials. Apicurio Registry provides role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles. Apicurio Registry provides content-based authorization at the schema or API level, where only the creator of the registry artifact can update or delete it. Apicurio Registry authentication and authorization settings are disabled by default. Prerequisites Keycloak is installed and running. For more details, see the Keycloak user documentation. Apicurio Registry is installed and running. Procedure In the Keycloak Admin Console, create a Keycloak realm for Apicurio Registry. By default, Apicurio Registry expects a realm name of registry. For details on creating realms, see the Keycloak user documentation. Create a Keycloak client for the Apicurio Registry API. By default, Apicurio Registry expects the following settings: Client ID: registry-api Client Protocol: openid-connect Access Type: bearer-only You can use the defaults for the other client settings. If you are using Keycloak service accounts, the client Access Type must be confidential instead of bearer-only. Create a Keycloak client for the Apicurio Registry web console. By default, Apicurio Registry expects the following settings: Client ID: apicurio-registry Client Protocol: openid-connect Access Type: public Valid Redirect URLs: http://my-registry-url:8080/* Web Origins: + You can use the defaults for the other client settings. In your Apicurio Registry deployment on OpenShift, set the following Apicurio Registry environment variables to configure authentication using Keycloak: Table 1.

For details on how to use Keycloak in a production environment, see the Keycloak documentation. This section explains how to manually configure authentication and authorization options for Apicurio Registry and Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The Apicurio Registry web console and core REST API support authentication in Azure AD based on OpenID Connect (OIDC) and the OAuth Authorization Code Flow. Apicurio Registry provides role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles. Apicurio Registry authentication and authorization settings are disabled by default. To secure Apicurio Registry with Azure AD, you require a valid directory in Azure AD with specific configuration. This involves registering the Apicurio Registry application in the Azure AD portal with recommended settings and configuring environment variables in Apicurio Registry. Prerequisites Azure AD is installed and running. For more details, see the Microsoft Azure AD user documentation. Apicurio Registry is installed and running. Procedure Log in to the Azure AD portal using your email address or GitHub account. In the navigation menu, select Manage > App registrations > New registration, and complete the following settings: Name: Enter your application name. For example: apicurio-registry-example Supported account types: Click Accounts in any organizational directory. Redirect URI: Select Single-page application from the list, and enter your Apicurio Registry web console application host. For example: https://test-registry.com/ui/ You must register your Apicurio Registry application host as a Redirect URI. When logging in, users are redirected from Apicurio Registry to Azure AD for authentication, and you want to send them back to your application afterwards. Azure AD does not allow any redirect URLs that are not registered. Click Register. You can view your app registration details by selecting Manage > App registrations > apicurio-registry-example. Select Manage > Authentication and ensure that the application is configured with your redirect URLs and tokens as follows: Redirect URIs: For example: https://test-registry.com/ui/ Implicit grant and hybrid flows: Click ID tokens (used for implicit and hybrid flows) Select Azure AD > Admin > App registrations > Your app > Application (client) ID. For example: 123456a7-b8c9-012d-e3f4-5fg67h8i901 Select Azure AD > Admin > App registrations > Your app > Directory (tenant) ID. For example: https://login.microsoftonline.com/1a2bc34d-567e-89f1-g0hi-1j2kl3m4no56/v2.0 In Apicurio Registry, configure the following environment variables with your Azure AD settings: Table 5. Configuration for Azure AD settings in Apicurio Registry Environment variable Description Setting KEYCLOAK_API_CLIENT_ID The client application ID for the Apicurio Registry REST API Your Azure AD Application (client) ID obtained in step 5. For example: 123456a7-b8c9-012d-e3f4-5fg67h8i901 REGISTRY_OIDC_UI_CLIENT_ID The client application ID for the Apicurio Registry web console. Your Azure AD Application (client) ID obtained in step 5. For example: 123456a7-b8c9-012d-e3f4-5fg67h8i901 REGISTRY_AUTH_URL_CONFIGURED The URL for authentication in Azure AD. Your Azure AD Application (tenant) ID obtained in step 6. For example: https://login.microsoftonline.com/1a2bc34d-567e-89f1-g0hi-1j2kl3m4no56/v2.0. In Apicurio Registry, configure the following environment variables for Apicurio Registry-specific settings: Table 6. Configuration for Apicurio Registry-specific settings Environment variable Description Setting REGISTRY_AUTH_ENABLED Enables authentication for Apicurio Registry. true REGISTRY_UI_AUTH_TYPE The Apicurio Registry authentication type. oidc CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS The host for your Apicurio Registry deployment for cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). For example: https://test-registry.com REGISTRY_OIDC_UI_REDIRECT_URL The host for your Apicurio Registry web console. For example: https://test-registry.com/ui ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_ENABLED Enables role-based authorization in Apicurio Registry. true QUARKUS_OIDC_ROLES_ROLE_CLAIM_PATH The name of the claim in which Azure AD stores roles. roles When you enable roles in Apicurio Registry, you must also create the same roles in Azure AD as application roles. The default roles expected by Apicurio Registry are sr-admin, sr-developer, and sr-readonly. Additional resources For details on configuring non-default user role names, see Apicurio Registry authentication and authorization configuration options. For more details on using Azure AD, see the Microsoft Azure AD user documentation. Apicurio Registry provides authentication options for OpenID Connect with Keycloak and HTTP basic authentication. Apicurio Registry provides authorization options for role-based and content-based approaches: Role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles. Content-based authorization for schema or API artifacts, where only the owner of the artifacts or artifact group can update or delete artifacts. All authentication and authorization options in Apicurio Registry are disabled by default. Before enabling any of these options, you must first set the AUTH_ENABLED option to true. This chapter provides details on the following configuration options: Apicurio Registry authentication by using OpenID Connect with Keycloak Apicurio Registry authentication by using HTTP basic Apicurio Registry role-based authorization Apicurio Registry owner-only authorization Apicurio Registry authenticated read access Apicurio Registry anonymous read-only access You can set the following environment variables to configure authentication for the Apicurio Registry web console and API with Keycloak: Table 7. Configuration for Apicurio Registry authentication with Keycloak Environment variable Description Type Default AUTH_ENABLED Enables authentication for Apicurio Registry. When set to true, the environment variables that follow are required for authentication using Keycloak. String false KEYCLOAK_URL The URL of the Keycloak authentication server. For example, http://localhost:8080. String - KEYCLOAK_REALM The Keycloak realm for authentication. For example, registry. String - KEYCLOAK_API_CLIENT_ID The client ID for the Apicurio Registry REST API. String registry-api KEYCLOAK_UI_CLIENT_ID The client ID for the Apicurio Registry web console. String apicurio-registry By default, Apicurio Registry supports authentication by using OpenID Connect. Users or API clients must obtain an access token to make authenticated calls to the Apicurio Registry REST API. However, because some tools do not support OpenID Connect, you can also configure Apicurio Registry to support HTTP basic authentication by setting the following configuration options to true: Table 8. Configuration for Apicurio Registry HTTP basic authentication Environment variable Java system property Type Default value AUTH_ENABLED registry.auth.enabled Boolean false CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_BASIC_AUTH_ENABLED registry.auth.basic-auth-client-credentials.enabled Boolean false You can also configure the HTTP basic client credentials cache expiry time. By default, when using HTTP basic authentication, Apicurio Registry caches JWT tokens, and does not issue a new token when there is no need. You can configure the cache expiry time for JWT tokens, which is set to 10 mins by default. When using Keycloak, it is best to set this configuration to your Keycloak JWT expiry time minus one minute. For example, if you have the expiry time set to 5 mins in Keycloak, you should set the following configuration option to 4 mins: Table 9. Configuration for HTTP basic client credentials cache expiry Environment variable Java system property Type Default value CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_BASIC_CACHE_EXPIRATION registry.auth.basic-auth-client-credentials.cache-expiration Integer 10 You can set the following options to true to enable role-based authorization in Apicurio Registry: Table 10. Configuration for Apicurio Registry role-based authorization Environment variable Java system property Type Default value AUTH_ENABLED registry.auth.enabled Boolean false ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_ENABLED registry.auth.role-based-authorization Boolean false You can then configure role-based authorization to use roles included in the user’s authentication token (for example, granted when authenticating by using Keycloak), or to use role mappings managed internally by Apicurio Registry. To enable using roles assigned by Keycloak, set the following environment variables: Table 11. Configuration for Apicurio Registry role-based authorization by using Keycloak Environment variable Description Type Default ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_SOURCE When set to token, user roles are taken from the authentication token. String token REGISTRY_AUTH_ROLES_ADMIN The name of the role that indicates a user is an admin. String sr-admin REGISTRY_AUTH_ROLES_DEVELOPER The name of the role that indicates a user is a developer. String sr-developer REGISTRY_AUTH_ROLES_READONLY The name of the role that indicates a user has read-only access. String sr-readonly When Apicurio Registry is configured to use roles from Keycloak, you must assign Apicurio Registry users to at least one of the following user roles in Keycloak. However, you can configure different user role names by using the environment variables in Configuration for Apicurio Registry role-based authorization by using Keycloak. Table 12. Apicurio Registry roles for authentication and authorization Role name Read artifacts Write artifacts Global rules Description sr-admin Yes Yes Yes Full access to all create, read, update, and delete operations. sr-developer Yes Yes No Access to create, read, update, and delete operations, except configuring global rules and import/export. This role can configure artifact-specific rules only. sr-readonly Yes No No Access to read and search operations only. This role cannot configure any rules. To enable using roles managed internally by Apicurio Registry, set the following environment variable: Table 13. Configuration for Apicurio Registry role-based authorization by using internal role mappings Environment variable Description Type Default ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_SOURCE When set to application, user roles are managed internally by Apicurio Registry. String token When using internally managed role mappings, users can be assigned a role by using the /admin/roleMappings endpoint in the Apicurio Registry REST API. For more details, see Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. Users can be granted exactly one role: ADMIN, DEVELOPER, or READ_ONLY. Only users with admin privileges can grant access to other users. Because there are no default admin users in Apicurio Registry, it is usually helpful to configure another way for users to be identified as admins. You can configure this admin-override feature by using the following environment variables: Table 14. Configuration for Apicurio Registry admin-override Environment variable Description Type Default REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_ENABLED Enables the admin-override feature. String false REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_FROM Where to look for admin-override information. Only token is currently supported. String token REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_TYPE The type of information used to determine if a user is an admin. Values depend on the value of the FROM variable, for example, role or claim when FROM is token. String role REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_ROLE The name of the role that indicates a user is an admin. String sr-admin REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_CLAIM The name of a JWT token claim to use for determining admin-override. String org-admin REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_CLAIM_VALUE The value that the JWT token claim indicated by the CLAIM variable must be for the user to be granted admin-override. String true For example, you can use this admin-override feature to assign the sr-admin role to a single user in Keycloak, which grants that user the admin role. That user can then use the /admin/roleMappings REST API (or associated UI) to grant roles to additional users (including additional admins). You can set the following options to true to enable owner-only authorization for updates to artifacts or artifact groups in Apicurio Registry: Table 15. Configuration for owner-only authorization Environment variable Java system property Type Default value AUTH_ENABLED registry.auth.enabled Boolean false REGISTRY_AUTH_OBAC_ENABLED registry.auth.owner-only-authorization Boolean false REGISTRY_AUTH_OBAC_LIMIT_GROUP_ACCESS registry.auth.owner-only-authorization.limit-group-access Boolean false When owner-only authorization is enabled, only the user who created an artifact can modify or delete that artifact. When owner-only authorization and group owner-only authorization are both enabled, only the user who created an artifact group has write access to that artifact group, for example, to add or remove artifacts in that group. When the authenticated read access option is enabled, Apicurio Registry grants at least read-only access to requests from any authenticated user in the same organization, regardless of their user role. To enable authenticated read access, you must first enable role-based authorization, and then ensure that the following options are set to true: Table 16. Configuration for authenticated read access Environment variable Java system property Type Default value AUTH_ENABLED registry.auth.enabled Boolean false REGISTRY_AUTH_AUTHENTICATED_READS_ENABLED registry.auth.authenticated-read-access.enabled Boolean false For more details, see Apicurio Registry role-based authorization. In addition to the two main types of authorization (role-based and owner-based authorization), Apicurio Registry supports an anonymous read-only access option. To allow anonymous users, such as REST API calls with no authentication credentials, to make read-only calls to the REST API, set the following options to true: Table 17.

This includes features such as the Apicurio Registry web console, logging, events, and health checks: Configuring the Apicurio Registry web console Configuring Apicurio Registry logging Configuring Apicurio Registry event sourcing Configuring Apicurio Registry health checks on OpenShift Environment variables for Apicurio Registry health checks For a list of all available configuration options, see Apicurio Registry configuration reference. You can set optional environment variables to configure the Apicurio Registry web console specifically for your deployment environment or to customize its behavior. Prerequisites You have already installed Apicurio Registry. When you access the Apicurio Registry web console in your browser, some initial configuration settings are loaded. The following configuration settings are important: URL for core Apicurio Registry server REST API URL for Apicurio Registry web console client Typically, Apicurio Registry automatically detects and generates these settings, but there are some deployment environments where this automatic detection can fail. If this happens, you can configure environment variables to explicitly set these URLs for your environment. Procedure Configure the following environment variables to override the default URLs: REGISTRY_UI_CONFIG_APIURL: Specifies the URL for the core Apicurio Registry server REST API. For example, https://registry.my-domain.com/apis/registry REGISTRY_UI_CONFIG_UIURL: Specifies the URL for the Apicurio Registry web console client. For example, https://registry.my-domain.com/ui You can configure the Apicurio Registry web console in read-only mode as an optional feature. This mode disables all features in the Apicurio Registry web console that allow users to make changes to registered artifacts. For example, this includes the following: Creating an artifact Uploading a new artifact version Updating artifact metadata Deleting an artifact Procedure Configure the following environment variable: REGISTRY_UI_FEATURES_READONLY: Set to true to enable read-only mode. Defaults to false. You can set Apicurio Registry logging configuration at runtime. Apicurio Registry provides a REST endpoint to set the log level for specific loggers for finer grained logging. This section explains how to view and set Apicurio Registry log levels at runtime using the Apicurio Registry /admin REST API. Prerequisites Get the URL to access your Apicurio Registry instance, or get your Apicurio Registry route if you have Apicurio Registry deployed on OpenShift. This simple example uses a URL of localhost:8080. Procedure Use this curl command to obtain the current log level for the logger io.apicurio.registry.storage: $ curl -i localhost:8080/apis/registry/v2/admin/loggers/io.apicurio.registry.storage HTTP/1.1 200 OK [...] Content-Type: application/json {\"name\":\"io.apicurio.registry.storage\",\"level\":\"INFO\"} Use this curl command to change the log level for the logger io.apicurio.registry.storage to DEBUG: $ curl -X PUT -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '{\"level\":\"DEBUG\"}' localhost:8080/apis/registry/v2/admin/loggers/io.apicurio.registry.storage HTTP/1.1 200 OK [...] Content-Type: application/json {\"name\":\"io.apicurio.registry.storage\",\"level\":\"DEBUG\"} Use this curl command to revert the log level for the logger io.apicurio.registry.storage to its default value: $ curl -X DELETE -i localhost:8080/apis/registry/v2/admin/loggers/io.apicurio.registry.storage HTTP/1.1 200 OK [...] Content-Type: application/json {\"name\":\"io.apicurio.registry.storage\",\"level\":\"INFO\"} This is a Technology Preview feature only, which might evolve in future releases. Before using this feature in production, make sure to test that your deployment works as expected. Review the Release Notes in future releases for updates on this feature. You can configure Apicurio Registry to send events when changes are made to registry content. For example, Apicurio Registry can trigger events when schema or API artifacts, groups, or content rules are created, updated, deleted, and so on. You can configure Apicurio Registry to send events to your applications and to third-party integrations for these kind of changes. There are different protocols available for transporting events. The currently implemented protocols are HTTP and Apache Kafka. However, regardless of the protocol, the events are sent by using the CNCF CloudEvents specification. You can configure Apicurio Registry event sourcing by using Java system properties or the equivalent environment variables. All of the event types are defined in io.apicurio.registry.events.dto.RegistryEventType. For example, these include the following event types: io.apicurio.registry.artifact-created io.apicurio.registry.artifact-updated io.apicurio.registry.artifact-state-changed io.apicurio.registry.artifact-rule-created io.apicurio.registry.global-rule-created io.apicurio.registry.group-created Prerequisites You must have an application that you want to send Apicurio Registry cloud events to. For example, this can be a custom application or a third-party application. The example in this section shows a custom application running on http://my-app-host:8888/events. Procedure When using the HTTP protocol, set your Apicurio Registry configuration to send events to a your application as follows: registry.events.sink.my-custom-consumer=http://my-app-host:8888/events If required, you can configure multiple event consumers as follows: registry.events.sink.my-custom-consumer=http://my-app-host:8888/events registry.events.sink.other-consumer=http://my-consumer.com/events The example in this section shows a Kafka topic named my-registry-events running on my-kafka-host:9092. Procedure When using the Kafka protocol, set your Kafka topic as follows: registry.events.kafka.topic=my-registry-events You can set the configuration for the Kafka producer by using the KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS environment variable: KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=my-kafka-host:9092 Alternatively, you can set the properties for the kafka producer by using the registry.events.kafka.config prefix, for example: registry.events.kafka.config.bootstrap.servers=my-kafka-host:9092 If required, you can also set the Kafka topic partition to use to produce events: registry.events.kafka.topic-partition=1 Additional resources For more details, see the CNCF CloudEvents specification. You can configure optional environment variables for liveness and readiness probes to monitor the health of the Apicurio Registry server on OpenShift: Liveness probes test if the application can make progress. If the application cannot make progress, OpenShift automatically restarts the failing Pod. Readiness probes test if the application is ready to process requests. If the application is not ready, it can become overwhelmed by requests, and OpenShift stops sending requests for the time that the probe fails. If other Pods are OK, they continue to receive requests. The default values of the liveness and readiness environment variables are designed for most cases and should only be changed if required by your environment. Any changes to the defaults depend on your hardware, network, and amount of data stored. These values should be kept as low as possible to avoid unnecessary overhead. Prerequisites You must have an OpenShift cluster with cluster administrator access. You must have already installed Apicurio Registry on OpenShift. You must have already installed and configured your chosen Apicurio Registry storage in Strimzi or PostgreSQL. Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Click Installed Operators > Apicurio Registry. On the ApicurioRegistry tab, click the Operator custom resource for your deployment, for example, example-apicurioregistry. In the main overview page, find the Deployment Name section and the corresponding DeploymentConfig name for your Apicurio Registry deployment, for example, example-apicurioregistry. In the left navigation menu, click Workloads > Deployment Configs, and select your DeploymentConfig name. Click the Environment tab, and enter your environment variables in the Single values env section, for example: NAME: LIVENESS_STATUS_RESET VALUE: 350 Click Save at the bottom. Alternatively, you can perform these steps using the OpenShift oc command. For more details, see the OpenShift CLI documentation. Additional resources Environment variables for Apicurio Registry health checks OpenShift documentation on monitoring application health This section describes the available environment variables for Apicurio Registry health checks on OpenShift. These include liveness and readiness probes to monitor the health of the Apicurio Registry server on OpenShift. For an example procedure, see Configuring Apicurio Registry health checks on OpenShift. The following environment variables are provided for reference only. The default values are designed for most cases and should only be changed if required by your environment. Any changes to the defaults depend on your hardware, network, and amount of data stored. These values should be kept as low as possible to avoid unnecessary overhead. Table 1. Environment variables for Apicurio Registry liveness probes Name Description Type Default LIVENESS_ERROR_THRESHOLD Number of liveness issues or errors that can occur before the liveness probe fails. Integer 1 LIVENESS_COUNTER_RESET Period in which the threshold number of errors must occur. For example, if this value is 60 and the threshold is 1, the check fails after two errors occur in 1 minute Seconds 60 LIVENESS_STATUS_RESET Number of seconds that must elapse without any more errors for the liveness probe to reset to OK status. Seconds 300 LIVENESS_ERRORS_IGNORED Comma-separated list of ignored liveness exceptions. String io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException,org.apache.kafka.streams.errors.InvalidStateStoreException Because OpenShift automatically restarts a Pod that fails a liveness check, the liveness settings, unlike readiness settings, do not directly affect behavior of Apicurio Registry on OpenShift. Table 2. Environment variables for Apicurio Registry readiness probes Name Description Type Default READINESS_ERROR_THRESHOLD Number of readiness issues or errors that can occur before the readiness probe fails. Integer 1 READINESS_COUNTER_RESET Period in which the threshold number of errors must occur. For example, if this value is 60 and the threshold is 1, the check fails after two errors occur in 1 minute. Seconds 60 READINESS_STATUS_RESET Number of seconds that must elapse without any more errors for the liveness probe to reset to OK status. In this case, this means how long the Pod stays not ready, until it returns to normal operation. Seconds 300 READINESS_TIMEOUT Readiness tracks the timeout of two operations: How long it takes for storage requests to complete How long it takes for HTTP REST API requests to return a response If these operations take more time than the configured timeout, this is counted as a readiness issue or error. This value controls the timeouts for both operations.

Additional resources Adding Operators to an OpenShift cluster Deploying and Managing AMQ Streams on OpenShift This section explains how to configure Kafka-based storage for Apicurio Registry using Strimzi on OpenShift. The kafkasql storage option uses Kafka storage with an in-memory H2 database for caching. This storage option is suitable for production environments when persistent storage is configured for the Kafka cluster on OpenShift. You can install Apicurio Registry in an existing Kafka cluster or create a new Kafka cluster, depending on your environment. Prerequisites You must have an OpenShift cluster with cluster administrator access. You must have already installed Apicurio Registry. See Installing Apicurio Registry on OpenShift. You must have already installed Strimzi. See Installing Strimzi from the OpenShift OperatorHub. Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. If you do not already have a Kafka cluster configured, create a new Kafka cluster using Strimzi. For example, in the OpenShift OperatorHub: Click Installed Operators and then Strimzi. Under Provided APIs and then Kafka, click Create Instance to create a new Kafka cluster. Edit the custom resource definition as appropriate, and click Create. The default example creates a cluster with 3 Zookeeper nodes and 3 Kafka nodes with ephemeral storage. This temporary storage is suitable for development and testing only, and not for production. For more details, see Deploying and Managing AMQ Streams on OpenShift. After the cluster is ready, click Provided APIs > Kafka > my-cluster > YAML. In the status block, make a copy of the bootstrapServers value, which you will use later to deploy Apicurio Registry.

Additional resources For more details on installing Strimzi and on creating Kafka clusters and topics, see https://strimzi.io/docs/overview/latest/ The default Kafka topic name that Apicurio Registry uses to store data is kafkasql-journal. This topic is created automatically by Apicurio Registry. However, you can override this behavior or the default topic name by setting the appropriate environment variable or Java system property: Table 1. Kafka topic name configuration Environment variable Java system property Default value REGISTRY_KAFKASQL_TOPIC registry.kafkasql.topic kafkasql-journal REGISTRY_KAFKASQL_TOPIC_AUTO_CREATE registry.kafkasql.topic.auto-create true When using Kafka-based storage in Strimzi, Apicurio Registry supports accessing a Kafka cluster that requires OAuth authentication. To enable this support, you must to set some environment variables in your Apicurio Registry deployment. When you set these environment variables, the Kafka producer and consumer applications in Apicurio Registry will use this configuration to authenticate to the Kafka cluster over OAuth. Prerequisites You must have already configured Kafka-based storage of Apicurio Registry data in Strimzi. See Configuring Apicurio Registry with Kafka storage on OpenShift.

You can install Apicurio Registry in an existing database or create a new database, depending on your environment. This section shows a simple example using the PostgreSQL Operator by Dev4Ddevs.com. Prerequisites You must have an OpenShift cluster with cluster administrator access. You must have already installed Apicurio Registry. See Installing Apicurio Registry on OpenShift. You must have already installed a PostgreSQL Operator on OpenShift. For example, see Installing a PostgreSQL database from the OpenShift OperatorHub. Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Change to the OpenShift project in which Apicurio Registry and your PostgreSQL Operator are installed. For example, from the Project drop-down, select my-project. Create a PostgreSQL database for your Apicurio Registry storage. For example, click Installed Operators, PostgreSQL Operator by Dev4Ddevs.com, and then Create database. Click YAML and edit the database settings as follows: name: Change the value to registry image: Change the value to centos/postgresql-12-centos7 Edit any other database settings as needed depending on your environment, for example: apiVersion: postgresql.dev4devs.com/v1alpha1 kind: Database metadata: name: registry namespace: my-project spec: databaseCpu: 30m databaseCpuLimit: 60m databaseMemoryLimit: 512Mi databaseMemoryRequest: 128Mi databaseName: example databaseNameKeyEnvVar: POSTGRESQL_DATABASE databasePassword: postgres databasePasswordKeyEnvVar: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD databaseStorageRequest: 1Gi databaseUser: postgres databaseUserKeyEnvVar: POSTGRESQL_USER image: centos/postgresql-12-centos7 size: 1 Click Create, and wait until the database is created. Click Installed Operators > Apicurio Registry > ApicurioRegistry > Create ApicurioRegistry. Paste in the following custom resource definition, and edit the values for the database url and credentials to match your environment: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry metadata: name: example-apicurioregistry-sql spec: configuration: persistence: 'sql' sql: dataSource: url: 'jdbc:postgresql://..svc:5432/' # e.g. url: 'jdbc:postgresql://acid-minimal-cluster.my-project.svc:5432/registry' userName: 'postgres' password: '' # Optional Click Create and wait for the Apicurio Registry route to be created on OpenShift. Click Networking > Route to access the new route for the Apicurio Registry web console.

All configured global rules or artifact-specific rules must pass before a new artifact version can be uploaded to Apicurio Registry. Configured artifact-specific rules override any configured global rules. The goal of these rules is to prevent invalid content from being added to Apicurio Registry. For example, content can be invalid for the following reasons: Invalid syntax for a given artifact type, for example, AVRO or PROTOBUF. Valid syntax, but semantics violate a specification. Incompatibility, when new content includes breaking changes relative to the current artifact version. Artifact reference integrity, for example, a duplicate or non-existent artifact reference mapping. You can enable optional content rules using the Apicurio Registry web console, REST API commands, or a Java client application. Rules are applied only when content is added to Apicurio Registry. This includes the following REST operations: Adding an artifact Updating an artifact Adding an artifact version If a rule is violated, Apicurio Registry returns an HTTP error. The response body includes the violated rule and a message showing what went wrong. The order of precedence for artifact-specific and global rules is as follows: If you enable an artifact-specific rule, and the equivalent global rule is enabled, the artifact rule overrides the global rule. If you disable an artifact-specific rule, and the equivalent global rule is enabled, the global rule applies. If you disable an artifact-specific rule, and the equivalent global rule is disabled, the rule is disabled for all artifacts. If you set a rule value to NONE at the artifact level, you override the enabled global rule. In this case, the artifact rule value of NONE takes precedence for this artifact, but the enabled global rule continues to apply to any other artifacts that have the rule disabled at the artifact level. Each rule has a name and configuration information. Apicurio Registry maintains the list of rules for each artifact and the list of global rules. Each rule in the list consists of a name and configuration for the rule implementation. A rule is provided with the content of the current version of the artifact (if one exists) and the new version of the artifact being added. The rule implementation returns true or false depending on whether the artifact passes the rule. If not, Apicurio Registry reports the reason why in an HTTP error response. Some rules might not use the previous version of the content. For example, compatibility rules use previous versions, but syntax or semantic validity rules do not. Additional resources For more details, see Apicurio Registry rule reference. Administrators can configure Apicurio Registry global rules and artifact-specific rules. Developers can configure artifact-specific rules only. Apicurio Registry applies the rules configured for the specific artifact. If no rules are configured at that level, Apicurio Registry applies the globally configured rules. If no global rules are configured, no rules are applied. You can configure artifact rules using the Apicurio Registry web console or REST API. For details, see the following: Managing Apicurio Registry content using the web console Apicurio Registry REST API documentation Administrators can configure global rules in several ways: Use the admin/rules operations in the REST API Use the Apicurio Registry web console Set default global rules using Apicurio Registry application properties Configure default global rules Administrators can configure Apicurio Registry at the application level to enable or disable global rules. You can configure default global rules at installation time without post-install configuration using the following application property format: registry.rules.global. The following rule names are currently supported: compatibility validity integrity The value of the application property must be a valid configuration option that is specific to the rule being configured. You can configure these application properties as Java system properties or include them in the Quarkus application.properties file.

Schema and API artifacts in Apicurio Registry Manage content using the Apicurio Registry web console Apicurio Registry REST API for clients Apicurio Registry storage options Validate Kafka messages using schemas and Java client serializers/deserializers Stream data to external systems with Kafka Connect converters Apicurio Registry demonstration examples Apicurio Registry available distributions Apicurio Registry is a datastore for sharing standard event schemas and API designs across event-driven and API architectures. You can use Apicurio Registry to decouple the structure of your data from your client applications, and to share and manage your data types and API descriptions at runtime using a REST interface. Client applications can dynamically push or pull the latest schema updates to or from Apicurio Registry at runtime without needing to redeploy. Developer teams can query Apicurio Registry for existing schemas required for services already deployed in production, and can register new schemas required for new services in development. You can enable client applications to use schemas and API designs stored in Apicurio Registry by specifying the Apicurio Registry URL in your client application code. Apicurio Registry can store schemas used to serialize and deserialize messages, which are referenced from your client applications to ensure that the messages that they send and receive are compatible with those schemas. Using Apicurio Registry to decouple your data structure from your applications reduces costs by decreasing overall message size, and creates efficiencies by increasing consistent reuse of schemas and API designs across your organization. Apicurio Registry provides a web console to make it easy for developers and administrators to manage registry content. You can configure optional rules to govern the evolution of your Apicurio Registry content. These include rules to ensure that uploaded content is valid, or is compatible with other versions. Any configured rules must pass before new versions can be uploaded to Apicurio Registry, which ensures that time is not wasted on invalid or incompatible schemas or API designs. Multiple payload formats for standard event schema and API specifications such as Apache Avro, JSON Schema, Google Protobuf, AsyncAPI, OpenAPI, and more. Pluggable Apicurio Registry storage options in Apache Kafka or PostgreSQL database. Rules for content validation, compatibility, and integrity to govern how Apicurio Registry content evolves over time. Apicurio Registry content management using web console, REST API, command line, Maven plug-in, or Java client. Full Apache Kafka schema registry support, including integration with Kafka Connect for external systems. Kafka client serializers/deserializers (SerDes) to validate message types at runtime. Compatibility with existing Confluent schema registry client applications. Cloud-native Quarkus Java runtime for low memory footprint and fast deployment times. Operator-based installation of Apicurio Registry on OpenShift. OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication using Keycloak. The items stored in Apicurio Registry, such as event schemas and API designs, are known as registry artifacts. The following shows an example of an Apache Avro schema artifact in JSON format for a simple share price application: Example Avro schema { \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"price\", \"namespace\": \"com.example\", \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"symbol\", \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"name\": \"price\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } When a schema or API design is added as an artifact in Apicurio Registry, client applications can then use that schema or API design to validate that the client messages conform to the correct data structure at runtime. An artifact group is an optional named collection of schema or API artifacts. Each group contains a logically related set of schemas or API designs, typically managed by a single entity, belonging to a particular application or organization. You can create optional artifact groups when adding your schemas and API designs to organize them in Apicurio Registry. For example, you could create groups to match your development and production application environments, or your sales and engineering organizations. Schema and API groups can contain multiple artifact types. For example, you could have Protobuf, Avro, JSON Schema, OpenAPI, or AsyncAPI artifacts all in the same group. You can create schema and API artifacts and groups using the Apicurio Registry web console, REST API, command line, Maven plug-in, or Java client application. The following simple example shows using the Core Registry REST API: $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-type: application/json; artifactType=AVRO\" \\ -H \"X-Registry-ArtifactId: share-price\" \\ --data '{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"price\",\"namespace\":\"com.example\", \\ \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]}' \\ https://my-registry.example.com/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts This example creates an artifact group named my-group and adds an Avro schema with an artifact ID of share-price. Specifying a group is optional when using the Apicurio Registry web console, and a default group is created automatically. When using the REST API or Maven plug-in, specify the default group in the API path if you do not want to create a unique group. Additional resources For information on supported artifact types, see Apicurio Registry artifact reference. For information on the Core Registry API, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. Some Apicurio Registry artifact types can include artifact references from one artifact file to another. You can create efficiencies by defining reusable schema or API components, and then referencing them from multiple locations. For example, you can specify a reference in JSON Schema or OpenAPI using a $ref statement, or in Google Protobuf using an import statement, or in Apache Avro using a nested namespace. The following example shows a simple Avro schema named TradeKey that includes a reference to another schema named Exchange using a nested namespace: Tradekey schema with nested Exchange schema { \"namespace\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.trade\", \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"TradeKey\", \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"exchange\", \"type\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.common.Exchange\" }, { \"name\": \"key\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } Exchange schema { \"namespace\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.common\", \"type\": \"enum\", \"name\": \"Exchange\", \"symbols\" : [\"GEMINI\"] } An artifact reference is stored in Apicurio Registry as a collection of artifact metadata that maps from an artifact type-specific reference to an internal Apicurio Registry reference. Each artifact reference in Apicurio Registry is composed of the following: Group ID Artifact ID Artifact version Artifact reference name You can manage artifact references using the Apicurio Registry core REST API, Maven plug-in, and Java serializers/deserializers (SerDes). Apicurio Registry stores the artifact references along with the artifact content. Apicurio Registry also maintains a collection of all artifact references so you can search them or list all references for a specific artifact. Apicurio Registry currently supports artifact references for the following artifact types only: Avro Protobuf JSON Schema OpenAPI AsyncAPI Additional resources For details on managing artifact references, see: Managing Apicurio Registry content using the REST API. Managing Apicurio Registry content using the Maven plug-in. For a Java example, see the Apicurio Registry SerDes with references demonstration. You can use the Apicurio Registry web console to browse and search the schema and API artifacts and optional groups stored in the registry, and to add new schema and API artifacts, groups, and versions. You can search for artifacts by label, name, group, and description. You can view an artifact’s content or its available versions, or download an artifact file locally. You can also configure optional rules for registry content, both globally and for each schema and API artifact. These optional rules for content validation and compatibility are applied when new schema and API artifacts or versions are uploaded to the registry. For more details, see Apicurio Registry rule reference. Figure 1. Apicurio Registry web console The Apicurio Registry web console is available from http://MY_REGISTRY_URL/ui. Additional resources Managing Apicurio Registry content using the web console Client applications can use the Core Registry API v2 to manage the schema and API artifacts in Apicurio Registry. This API provides operations for the following features: Admin Export or import Apicurio Registry data in a .zip file, and manage logging levels for the Apicurio Registry instance at runtime. Artifacts Manage schema and API artifacts stored in Apicurio Registry. You can also manage the lifecycle state of an artifact: enabled, disabled, or deprecated. Artifact metadata Manage details about a schema or API artifact. You can edit details such as artifact name, description, or labels. Details such as artifact group, and when the artifact was created or modified are read-only. Artifact rules Configure rules to govern the content evolution of a specific schema or API artifact to prevent invalid or incompatible content from being added to Apicurio Registry. Artifact rules override any global rules configured. Artifact versions Manage versions that are created when a schema or API artifact is updated. You can also manage the lifecycle state of an artifact version: enabled, disabled, or deprecated. Global rules Configure rules to govern the content evolution of all schema and API artifacts to prevent invalid or incompatible content from being added to Apicurio Registry. Global rules are applied only if an artifact does not have its own specific artifact rules configured. Search Browse or search for schema and API artifacts and versions, for example, by name, group, description, or label. System Get the Apicurio Registry version and the limits on resources for the Apicurio Registry instance. Users Get the current Apicurio Registry user. Apicurio Registry also provides compatibility with the following schema registries by including implementations of their respective REST APIs: Apicurio Registry Core Registry API v1 Confluent Schema Registry API v6 Confluent Schema Registry API v7 CNCF CloudEvents Schema Registry API v0 Applications using Confluent client libraries can use Apicurio Registry as a drop-in replacement. Additional resources For more information on the Core Registry API v2, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. For API documentation on the Core Registry API v2 and all compatible APIs, browse to the /apis endpoint of your Apicurio Registry instance, for example, http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis. Apicurio Registry provides the following options for the underlying storage of registry data: Table 1. Apicurio Registry data storage options Storage option Description In-memory The in-memory storage option is suitable for a development environment only. All data is lost when restarting Apicurio Registry with this storage. The PostgreSQL or Kafka storage option is recommended for a production environment. PostgreSQL database PostgreSQL is the recommended data storage option for performance, stability, and data management (backup/restore, and so on) in a production environment. Apache Kafka Kafka storage is provided for production environments where database management expertise is not available, or where storage in Kafka is a specific requirement. Additional resources Installing Apicurio Registry using Docker Installing Apicurio Registry on OpenShift Installing Apicurio Registry storage on OpenShift Kafka producer applications can use serializers to encode messages that conform to a specific event schema. Kafka consumer applications can then use deserializers to validate that messages have been serialized using the correct schema, based on a specific schema ID. Figure 2. Apicurio Registry and Kafka client SerDes architecture Apicurio Registry provides Kafka client serializers/deserializers (SerDes) to validate the following message types at runtime: Apache Avro Google Protobuf JSON Schema The Apicurio Registry Maven repository and source code distributions include the Kafka SerDes implementations for these message types, which Kafka client application developers can use to integrate with Apicurio Registry. These implementations include custom Java classes for each supported message type, for example, io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro, which client applications can use to pull schemas from Apicurio Registry at runtime for validation. Additional resources Validating schemas using Kafka client serializers/deserializers in Java clients You can use Apicurio Registry with Apache Kafka Connect to stream data between Kafka and external systems. Using Kafka Connect, you can define connectors for different systems to move large volumes of data into and out of Kafka-based systems. Figure 3. Apicurio Registry and Kafka Connect architecture Apicurio Registry provides the following features for Kafka Connect: Storage for Kafka Connect schemas Kafka Connect converters for Apache Avro and JSON Schema Core Registry API to manage schemas You can use the Avro and JSON Schema converters to map Kafka Connect schemas into Avro or JSON schemas. These schemas can then serialize message keys and values into the compact Avro binary format or human-readable JSON format. The converted JSON is less verbose because the messages do not contain the schema information, only the schema ID. Apicurio Registry can manage and track the Avro and JSON schemas used in the Kafka topics. Because the schemas are stored in Apicurio Registry and decoupled from the message content, each message must only include a tiny schema identifier. For an I/O bound system like Kafka, this means more total throughput for producers and consumers. The Avro and JSON Schema serializers and deserializers (SerDes) provided by Apicurio Registry are used by Kafka producers and consumers in this use case. Kafka consumer applications that you write to consume change events can use the Avro or JSON SerDes to deserialize these events. You can install the Apicurio Registry SerDes in any Kafka-based system and use them along with Kafka Connect, or with a Kafka Connect-based system such as Debezium. Additional resources Configuring Debezium to use Avro serialization and Apicurio Registry Example of using Debezium to monitor the PostgreSQL database used by Apicurio Registry Apache Kafka Connect documentation Apicurio Registry provides open source example applications that demonstrate how to use Apicurio Registry in different use case scenarios. For example, these include storing schemas used by Kafka serializer and deserializer (SerDes) Java classes. These classes fetch the schema from Apicurio Registry for use when producing or consuming operations to serialize, deserialize, or validate the Kafka message payload. These applications demonstrate use cases such as the following examples: Apache Avro Kafka SerDes Apache Avro Maven plug-in Apache Camel Quarkus and Kafka CloudEvents Confluent Kafka SerDes Custom ID strategy Event-driven architecture with Debezium Google Protobuf Kafka SerDes JSON Schema Kafka SerDes REST clients Additional resources For more details, see https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-registry-examples Apicurio Registry provides the following distribution options.

The Core Registry API v2 provides operations for artifacts, versions, metadata, and rules stored in Apicurio Registry. For detailed information, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. This chapter shows examples of how to use the Core Registry API v2 to perform the following tasks: Managing schema and API artifacts using Apicurio Registry REST API commands Managing schema and API artifact versions using Apicurio Registry REST API commands Managing schema and API artifact references using Apicurio Registry REST API commands Exporting and importing registry data using Apicurio Registry REST API commands Prerequisites Introduction to Apicurio Registry Additional resources Apicurio Registry REST API documentation This section shows a simple curl-based example of using the Core Registry API v2 to add and retrieve a simple schema artifact in Apicurio Registry. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment. Procedure Add an artifact to Apicurio Registry using the /groups/{group}/artifacts operation. The following example curl command adds a simple schema artifact for a share price application: $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json; artifactType=AVRO\" \\ -H \"X-Registry-ArtifactId: share-price\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --data '{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"price\",\"namespace\":\"com.example\", \\ \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]}' \\ MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts This example adds an Apache Avro schema artifact with an artifact ID of share-price. If you do not specify a unique artifact ID, Apicurio Registry generates one automatically as a UUID. MY-REGISTRY-URL is the host name on which Apicurio Registry is deployed. For example: http://localhost:8080. This example specifies a group ID of my-group in the API path. If you do not specify a unique group ID, you must specify ../groups/default in the API path. Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body to confirm that the artifact was added. For example: {\"createdBy\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2021-04-16T09:07:51+0000\",\"modifiedBy\":\"\", \"modifiedOn\":\"2021-04-16T09:07:51+0000\",\"id\":\"share-price\",\"version\":\"1\", \"type\":\"AVRO\",\"globalId\":2,\"state\":\"ENABLED\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"contentId\":2} No version was specified when adding the artifact, so the default version 1 is created automatically. This was the second artifact added to Apicurio Registry, so the global ID and content ID have a value of 2. Retrieve the artifact content from Apicurio Registry using its artifact ID in the API path. In this example, the specified ID is share-price: $ curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts/share-price {\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"price\",\"namespace\":\"com.example\", \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]} Additional resources For more details, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. If you do not specify an artifact version when adding schema and API artifacts using the Core Registry API v2, Apicurio Registry generates a version automatically. The default version when creating a new artifact is 1. Apicurio Registry also supports custom versioning where you can specify a version using the X-Registry-Version HTTP request header as a string. Specifying a custom version value overrides the default version normally assigned when creating or updating an artifact. You can then use this version value when executing REST API operations that require a version. This section shows a simple curl-based example of using the Core Registry API v2 to add and retrieve a custom Apache Avro schema version in Apicurio Registry. You can specify custom versions to add or update artifacts, or to add artifact versions. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment. Procedure Add an artifact version in the registry using the /groups/{group}/artifacts operation. The following example curl command adds a simple artifact for a share price application: $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json; artifactType=AVRO\" \\ -H \"X-Registry-ArtifactId: my-share-price\" -H \"X-Registry-Version: 1.1.1\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --data '{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\" p\",\"namespace\":\"com.example\", \\ \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]}' \\ MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts This example adds an Avro schema artifact with an artifact ID of my-share-price and version of 1.1.1. If you do not specify a version, Apicurio Registry automatically generates a default version of 1. MY-REGISTRY-URL is the host name on which Apicurio Registry is deployed. For example: http://localhost:8080. This example specifies a group ID of my-group in the API path. If you do not specify a unique group ID, you must specify ../groups/default in the API path. Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body to confirm that the custom artifact version was added. For example: {\"createdBy\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2021-04-16T10:51:43+0000\",\"modifiedBy\":\"\", \"modifiedOn\":\"2021-04-16T10:51:43+0000\",\"id\":\"my-share-price\",\"version\":\"1.1.1\", \"type\":\"AVRO\",\"globalId\":3,\"state\":\"ENABLED\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"contentId\":3} A custom version of 1.1.1 was specified when adding the artifact. This was the third artifact added to the registry, so the global ID and content ID have a value of 3. Retrieve the artifact content from the registry using its artifact ID and version in the API path. In this example, the specified ID is my-share-price and the version is 1.1.1: $ curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts/my-share-price/versions/1.1.1 {\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"price\",\"namespace\":\"com.example\", \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]} Additional resources For more details, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. Some Apicurio Registry artifact types can include artifact references from one artifact file to another. You can create efficiencies by defining reusable schema or API artifacts, and then referencing them from multiple locations in artifact references. The following artifact types support artifact references: Apache Avro Google Protobuf JSON Schema OpenAPI AsyncAPI This section shows a simple curl-based example of using the Core Registry API v2 to add and retrieve an artifact reference to a simple Avro schema artifact in Apicurio Registry. This example first creates a schema artifact named ItemId: ItemId schema { \"namespace\":\"com.example.common\", \"name\":\"ItemId\", \"type\":\"record\", \"fields\":[ { \"name\":\"id\", \"type\":\"int\" } ] } This example then creates a schema artifact named Item, which includes a reference to the nested ItemId artifact. Item schema with nested ItemId schema { \"namespace\":\"com.example.common\", \"name\":\"Item\", \"type\":\"record\", \"fields\":[ { \"name\":\"itemId\", \"type\":\"com.example.common.ItemId\" }, ] } Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment. Procedure Add the ItemId schema artifact that you want to create the nested artifact reference to using the /groups/{group}/artifacts operation: $ curl -X POST MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json; artifactType=AVRO\" \\ -H \"X-Registry-ArtifactId: ItemId\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --data '{\"namespace\": \"com.example.common\", \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"ItemId\", \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"id\", \"type\":\"int\"}]}' This example adds an Avro schema artifact with an artifact ID of ItemId. If you do not specify a unique artifact ID, Apicurio Registry generates one automatically as a UUID. MY-REGISTRY-URL is the host name on which Apicurio Registry is deployed. For example: http://localhost:8080. This example specifies a group ID of my-group in the API path. If you do not specify a unique group ID, you must specify ../groups/default in the API path. Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body to confirm that the artifact was added. For example: {\"name\":\"ItemId\",\"createdBy\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2022-04-14T10:50:09+0000\",\"modifiedBy\":\"\",\"modifiedOn\":\"2022-04-14T10:50:09+0000\",\"id\":\"ItemId\",\"version\":\"1\",\"type\":\"AVRO\",\"globalId\":1,\"state\":\"ENABLED\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"contentId\":1,\"references\":[]} Add the Item schema artifact that includes the artifact reference to the ItemId schema using the /groups/{group}/artifacts operation: $ curl -X POST MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/create.extended+json' \\ -H \"X-Registry-ArtifactId: Item\" \\ -H 'X-Registry-ArtifactType: AVRO' \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --data-raw '{ \"content\": \"{\\r\\n \\\"namespace\\\":\\\"com.example.common\\\",\\r\\n \\\"name\\\":\\\"Item\\\",\\r\\n \\\"type\\\":\\\"record\\\",\\r\\n \\\"fields\\\":[\\r\\n {\\r\\n \\\"name\\\":\\\"itemId\\\",\\r\\n \\\"type\\\":\\\"com.example.common.ItemId\\\"\\r\\n }\\r\\n ]\\r\\n}\", \"references\": [ { \"groupId\": \"my-group\", \"artifactId\": \"ItemId\", \"name\": \"com.example.common.ItemId\", \"version\": \"1\" } ] }' For artifact references, you must specify the custom content type of application/create.extended+json, which extends the application/json content type. Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body to confirm that the artifact was created with the reference. For example: {\"name\":\"Item\",\"createdBy\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2022-04-14T11:52:15+0000\",\"modifiedBy\":\"\",\"modifiedOn\":\"2022-04-14T11:52:15+0000\",\"id\":\"Item\",\"version\":\"1\",\"type\":\"AVRO\",\"globalId\":2,\"state\":\"ENABLED\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"contentId\":2, \"references\":[{\"artifactId\":\"ItemId\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"name\":\"ItemId\",\"version\":\"1\"}] } Retrieve the artifact reference from Apicurio Registry by specifying the global ID of the artifact that includes the reference. In this example, the specified global ID is 2: $ curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/ids/globalIds/2/references Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body for this artifact reference. For example: [{\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"artifactId\":\"ItemId\",\"version\":\"1\",\"name\":\"com.example.common.ItemId\"}] Dereference artifact content There are some cases where returning artifact content with referenced content inline might be helpful. For these cases, the Core Registry API v2 supports the dereference query parameter in certain operations. This support is currently implemented only for Avro and Protobuf artifacts when the dereference parameter is specified in the API operation. This parameter is not supported for any other artifact types. For Protobuf artifacts, dereferencing content is supported only when all of the schemas belong to the same package. Additional resources For more details, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. For more examples of artifact references, see the section on configuring each artifact type in Configuring Kafka serializers/deserializers in Java clients. As an administrator, you can use the Core Registry API v2 to export data from one Apicurio Registry instance and import into another Apicurio Registry instance, so you can migrate data between different instances. This section shows a simple curl-based example of using the Core Registry API v2 to export and import existing data in .zip format from one Apicurio Registry instance to another. All of the artifact data contained in the Apicurio Registry instance is exported in the .zip file. You can import only Apicurio Registry data that has been exported from another Apicurio Registry instance. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment. Apicurio Registry instances have been created: The source instance that you want to export data from contains at least one schema or API artifact. The target instance that you want to import data into is empty to preserve unique IDs. Procedure Export the Apicurio Registry data from your existing source Apicurio Registry instance: $ curl MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/admin/export \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --output my-registry-data.zip MY-REGISTRY-URL is the host name on which the source Apicurio Registry is deployed. For example: http://my-source-registry:8080. Import the registry data into your target Apicurio Registry instance: $ curl -X POST \"MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/admin/import\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/zip\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --data-binary @my-registry-data.zip MY-REGISTRY-URL is the host name on which the target Apicurio Registry is deployed. For example: http://my-target-registry:8080. Additional resources For more details, see the admin endpoint in the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation.

For more examples of artifact references, see the section on configuring each artifact type in Configuring Kafka serializers/deserializers in Java clients. Some Apicurio Registry artifact types can include artifact references from one artifact file to another. You can create efficiencies by defining reusable schema or API artifacts, and then referencing them from multiple locations in artifact references. The following artifact types support artifact references: Apache Avro Google Protobuf JSON Schema OpenAPI AsyncAPI You can specify a single artifact and configure the Apicurio Registry Maven plugin to automatically detect all references to artifacts located in the same directory, and to automatically register those references. This is a Technology Preview feature. Technology Preview features are not supported with RedHat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. RedHat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. For more information about the support scope of RedHat Technology Preview features, see Technology Preview Features Support Scope. This section shows a simple example of using the Maven plug-in to register an Avro schema and automatically detect and register an artifact reference to a simple schema artifact. This example assumes that the parent TradeKey artifact and the nested Exchange schema artifact are both available in the same directory: TradeKey schema with nested reference to Exchange schema { \"namespace\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.trade\", \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"TradeKey\", \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"exchange\", \"type\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.common.Exchange\" }, { \"name\": \"key\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } Exchange schema { \"namespace\": \"com.kubetrade.schema.common\", \"type\": \"enum\", \"name\": \"Exchange\", \"symbols\" : [\"GEMINI\"] } Prerequisites You have created a Maven project for your client application.

If this field is empty, all paths are included. Exclude path patterns: Enter specific paths to exclude when generating the client SDK, for example, **/my-other-path/*. If this field is empty, no paths are excluded. Figure 4. Generate a Java client SDK in Apicurio Registry web console When you have configured the settings in the dialog, click Generate and download. Enter a file name for the client SDK in the dialog, for example, my-client-java.zip, and click Save to download. Additional resources Apicurio Registry uses Kiota from Microsoft to generate the client SDKs. For more information, see the Kiota project in GitHub. For more details and examples of using the generated SDKs to build client applications, see the Kiota documentation. As an administrator or as an owner of a schema or API artifact, you can use the Apicurio Registry web console to change the artifact owner to another user account. For example, this feature is useful if the Artifact owner-only authorization option is set for the Apicurio Registry instance on the Settings tab so that only owners or administrators can modify artifacts. You might need to change owner if the owner user leaves the organization or the owner account is deleted. The Artifact owner-only authorization setting and the artifact Owner field are displayed only if authentication was enabled when the Apicurio Registry instance was deployed. For more details, see Configuring your Apicurio Registry deployment. Prerequisites The Apicurio Registry instance is deployed and the artifact is created. You are logged in to the Apicurio Registry web console as the artifact’s current owner or as an administrator: http://MY_REGISTRY_URL/ui Procedure On the Artifacts tab, browse the list of artifacts stored in Apicurio Registry, or enter a search string to find the artifact.

Migration from Apicurio Registry 1.3 to 2.x Migrating Apicurio Registry data Migrating Apicurio Registry client applications Apicurio Registry 2.x includes new features with breaking changes from the previous Apicurio Registry 1.3 release. This section describes the major changes between Apicurio Registry 1.3 and version 2.x. Because of the breaking changes in 2.x, there is no automatic upgrade and a migration process is required. This involves moving the data in your existing registry to a new registry. You must also review your existing registry client applications and update their configuration to meet the new requirements. When migrating to version 2.x, you must take the following major changes into account: The existing registry data storage options in Apicurio Registry 1.3 (streams,jpa, and infinispan) have been replaced with new storage options in version 2.x (sql and kafkasql). These new storage options provide more robust, performant, and maintainable Apicurio Registry deployments. The in-memory storage option (mem) is also still available, but is not suitable for production workloads. For details on how to deploy Apicurio Registry 2.x with your chosen storage option, see Installing Apicurio Registry storage on OpenShift. Apicurio Registry 2.x includes a new REST API with support for artifact groups and improved long term maintainability. Apicurio Registry still supports the original registry v1 REST API and compatibility APIs, for example, Confluent and IBM schema registry APIs. Apicurio Registry now also implements the Schema Registry specification provided in the CNCF Cloud Events specification. The Apicurio Registry Java client classes are available in version 2.x in a different Maven module named apicurio-registry-client. The Kafka client serializer and deserializer (SerDes) classes are available in version 2.x in three different Maven modules, one for each supported data format: Apache Avro, Protobuf, and JSON Schema. You can now use only the module you want without pulling in transitive dependencies that you are not concerned with. Additional resources For more details on the v2 REST API, see the Registry REST API documentation. Migrating data to Apicurio Registry 2.x requires exporting all data from your existing 1.3 deployment and importing it into the new 2.x deployment. If you are using Apicurio Registry as a schema registry for Kafka applications, data migration is critical because each Kafka message carries the global identifier for the schema stored in Apicurio Registry. This identifier must be preserved during registry data migration. Apicurio Registry 2.x provides an API to bulk import/export all data from your registry deployment, which guarantees that all identifiers are kept when importing data from your existing registry. The export API downloads a custom .zip file containing all the information for your artifacts. The import API accepts this .zip and loads all artifacts into the registry in a single batch. Apicurio Registry 1.3 does not provide an import/export API. However, version 2.x provides an export tool compatible with Apicurio Registry 1.3 to export a .zip, which you can import into your 2.x registry. This tool uses common existing APIs to export all content in the registry. However, it is less performant than the 2.x export API, and should only be used when exporting from a 1.3 registry. Prerequisites Running Apicurio Registry instances of the 1.3 server you are exporting from and the 2.x server you are importing into. Download the Apicurio Registry exportV1 tool from GitHub. This is a Java application that you can run on the command line. Procedure Export all the data from Apicurio Registry 1.3 using the exportV1 tool. This generates a registry-export.zip file in your current directory: java -jar apicurio-registry-utils-exportV1-2.5.9.Final.jar http://old-registry.my-company.com/api Import the .zip file into Apicurio Registry 2.x using the import API: curl -X POST \"http://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v2/admin/import\" \\ -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/zip\" \\ --data-binary @registry-export.zip Check that all the artifacts have been imported into the new 2.x registry by running these commands and comparing the count field: curl \"http://old-registry.my-company.com/api/search/artifacts\" curl \"http://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v2/search/artifacts\" Additional resources For more details on the import/export REST API, see Managing Apicurio Registry content using the REST API For more details on the export tool for migrating from version 1.x to 2.x, see the Apicurio Registry export utility for 1.x versions. You must review your existing Apicurio Registry client applications to ensure that the Maven dependencies and Java client configuration meet the new requirements for version 2.x. For example, this includes new Maven dependencies for the Apicurio Registry Java REST client libraries or Kafka client serializer/deserializer (Serdes) libraries. You must also update your Java application configuration with the new registry v2 API path. Prerequisites Existing Apicurio Registry 1.3 Java client application or Kafka client producer and consumer Java applications with SerDes Procedure If you are using the Apicurio Registry Java REST client, you must change the Maven dependencies for the Apicurio Registry Java client libraries, which have been repackaged in version 2.x: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-client 2.5.9.Final In your Java client application, you must change your registry URL configuration, from pointing to the existing v1 API path to the new v2 path. For example: public class ClientExample { private static final RegistryRestClient client; public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { // Create a registry client String registryUrl = \"https://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v2\"; RegistryClient client = RegistryClientFactory.create(registryUrl); } } You can find more details on the Java client in Managing Apicurio Registry content using a Java client. If you are using the Apicurio Registry SerDes libraries, you must change the Maven dependencies, which have been repackaged in version 2.x. In Apicurio Registry 1.3, the SerDes libraries were all provided with only one Maven dependency: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-utils-serde 1.3.2.Final In Apicurio Registry 2.x, the SerDes libraries have been split into three Maven dependencies, one for each supported data format: avro, protobuf, and json schema, depending on your use cases: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-serdes-avro-serde 2.5.9.Final io.apicurio apicurio-registry-serdes-protobuf-serde 2.5.9.Final io.apicurio apicurio-registry-serdes-jsonschema-serde 2.5.9.Final In your Kafka producer and consumer Java applications, you must change your registry URL configuration from pointing to the existing v1 API path to the new v2 path. For example: Existing registry v1 API path: props.putIfAbsent(AbstractKafkaSerDe.REGISTRY_URL_CONFIG_PARAM, \"http://old-registry.my-company.com/api\"); New registry v2 API path: props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.REGISTRY_URL, \"http://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v2\"); The refactored SerDes libraries also include other important changes to configuration properties.

Kafka producer applications use serializers to encode messages that conform to a specific event schema. Kafka consumer applications use deserializers to validate that messages have been serialized using the correct schema, based on a specific schema ID. This ensures consistent schema use and helps to prevent data errors at runtime. This chapter explains how to use Kafka client SerDes in your producer and consumer client applications: Kafka client applications and Apicurio Registry Strategies to look up a schema in Apicurio Registry Registering a schema in Apicurio Registry Using a schema from a Kafka consumer client Using a schema from a Kafka producer client Using a schema from a Kafka Streams application Prerequisites You have read Introduction to Apicurio Registry. You have installed Apicurio Registry. You have created Kafka producer and consumer client applications. Apicurio Registry decouples schema management from client application configuration. You can enable a Java client application to use a schema from Apicurio Registry by specifying its URL in your client code. You can store the schemas in Apicurio Registry to serialize and deserialize messages, which are referenced from your client applications to ensure that the messages that they send and receive are compatible with those schemas. Kafka client applications can push or pull their schemas from Apicurio Registry at runtime. Schemas can evolve, so you can define rules in Apicurio Registry, for example, to ensure that schema changes are valid and do not break previous versions used by applications. Apicurio Registry checks for compatibility by comparing a modified schema with previous schema versions. Apicurio Registry provides schema registry support for schema technologies such as: Avro Protobuf JSON Schema These schema technologies can be used by client applications through the Kafka client serializer/deserializer (SerDes) services provided by Apicurio Registry. The maturity and usage of the SerDes classes provided by Apicurio Registry might vary. The sections that follow provide more details about each schema type. A producer client application uses a serializer to put the messages that it sends to a specific broker topic into the correct data format. To enable a producer to use Apicurio Registry for serialization: Define and register your schema with Apicurio Registry (if it does not already exist). Configure your producer client code with the following: URL of Apicurio Registry Apicurio Registry serializer to use with messages Strategy to map the Kafka message to a schema artifact in Apicurio Registry Strategy to look up or register the schema used for serialization in Apicurio Registry After registering your schema, when you start Kafka and Apicurio Registry, you can access the schema to format messages sent to the Kafka broker topic by the producer. Alternatively, depending on configuration, the producer can automatically register the schema on first use. If a schema already exists, you can create a new version using the registry REST API based on compatibility rules defined in Apicurio Registry. Versions are used for compatibility checking as a schema evolves. A group ID, artifact ID, and version represents a unique tuple that identifies a schema. A consumer client application uses a deserializer to get the messages that it consumes from a specific broker topic into the correct data format. To enable a consumer to use Apicurio Registry for deserialization: Define and register your schema with Apicurio Registry (if it does not already exist) Configure the consumer client code with the following: URL of Apicurio Registry Apicurio Registry deserializer to use with the messages Input data stream for deserialization Retrieve schemas using a global ID By default, the schema is retrieved from Apicurio Registry by the deserializer using a global ID, which is specified in the message being consumed. The schema global ID can be located in the message headers or in the message payload, depending on the configuration of the producer application. When locating the global ID in the message payload, the format of the data begins with a magic byte, used as a signal to consumers, followed by the global ID, and the message data as normal. For example: # ... [MAGIC_BYTE] [GLOBAL_ID] [MESSAGE DATA] Then when you start Kafka and Apicurio Registry, you can access the schema to format messages received from the Kafka broker topic. Retrieve schemas using a content ID Alternatively, you can configure to retrieve schemas from Apicurio Registry based on the content ID, which is the unique ID of the artifact content. While the global ID is the unique ID of an artifact version. The content ID does not uniquely identify a version, but uniquely identifies the version content only. If multiple versions share the exact same content, they have a different global ID but the same content ID. Confluent Schema Registry uses content ID by default. The Kafka client serializer uses lookup strategies to determine the artifact ID and global ID under which the message schema is registered in Apicurio Registry. For a given topic and message, you can use different implementations of the ArtifactReferenceResolverStrategy Java interface to return a reference to an artifact in the registry. The classes for each strategy are in the io.apicurio.registry.serde.strategy package. Specific strategy classes for Avro SerDes are in the io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro.strategy package. The default strategy is the TopicIdStrategy, which looks for Apicurio Registry artifacts with the same name as the Kafka topic receiving messages. Example public ArtifactReference artifactReference(String topic, boolean isKey, T schema) { return ArtifactReference.builder() .groupId(null) .artifactId(String.format(\"%s-%s\", topic, isKey ? \"key\" : \"value\")) .build(); The topic parameter is the name of the Kafka topic receiving the message. The isKey parameter is true when the message key is serialized, and false when the message value is serialized. The schema parameter is the schema of the message serialized or deserialized. The ArtifactReference returned contains the artifact ID under which the schema is registered. Which lookup strategy you use depends on how and where you store your schema. For example, you might use a strategy that uses a record ID if you have different Kafka topics with the same Avro message type. The artifact resolver strategy provides a way to map the Kafka topic and message information to an artifact in Apicurio Registry. The common convention for the mapping is to combine the Kafka topic name with the key or value, depending on whether the serializer is used for the Kafka message key or value. However, you can use alternative conventions for the mapping by using a strategy provided by Apicurio Registry, or by creating a custom Java class that implements io.apicurio.registry.serde.strategy.ArtifactReferenceResolverStrategy. Apicurio Registry provides the following strategies to return a reference to an artifact based on an implementation of ArtifactReferenceResolverStrategy: RecordIdStrategy Avro-specific strategy that uses the full name of the schema. TopicRecordIdStrategy Avro-specific strategy that uses the topic name and the full name of the schema. TopicIdStrategy Default strategy that uses the topic name and key or value suffix. SimpleTopicIdStrategy Simple strategy that only uses the topic name. The default schema resolver locates and identifies the specific version of the schema registered under the artifact reference provided by the artifact resolver strategy. Every version of every artifact has a single globally unique identifier that can be used to retrieve the content of that artifact. This global ID is included in every Kafka message so that a deserializer can properly fetch the schema from Apicurio Registry. The default schema resolver can look up an existing artifact version, or it can register one if not found, depending on which strategy is used. You can also provide your own strategy by creating a custom Java class that implements io.apicurio.registry.resolver.SchemaResolver. However, it is recommended to use the DefaultSchemaResolver and specify configuration properties instead. When using the DefaultSchemaResolver, you can configure its behavior using application properties. The following table shows some commonly used examples: Table 1. Apicurio Registry lookup configuration options Property Type Description Default apicurio.registry.find-latest boolean Specify whether the serializer tries to find the latest artifact in the registry for the corresponding group ID and artifact ID. false apicurio.registry.use-id String Instructs the serializer to write the specified ID to Kafka and instructs the deserializer to use this ID to find the schema. None apicurio.registry.auto-register boolean Specify whether the serializer tries to create an artifact in the registry. The JSON Schema serializer does not support this. false apicurio.registry.check-period-ms String Specify how long to cache the global ID in milliseconds. If not configured, the global ID is fetched every time. None After you have defined a schema in the appropriate format, such as Apache Avro, you can add the schema to Apicurio Registry. You can add the schema using the following approaches: Apicurio Registry web console curl command using the Apicurio Registry REST API Maven plug-in supplied with Apicurio Registry Schema configuration added to your client code Client applications cannot use Apicurio Registry until you have registered your schemas. When Apicurio Registry is installed, you can connect to the web console from the ui endpoint: http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/ui From the console, you can add, view and configure schemas. You can also create the rules that prevent invalid content being added to the registry. curl -X POST -H \"Content-type: application/json; artifactType=AVRO\" \\ -H \"X-Registry-ArtifactId: share-price\" \\ (1) --data '{ \"type\":\"record\", \"name\":\"price\", \"namespace\":\"com.example\", \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"}, {\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]}' https://my-cluster-my-registry-my-project.example.com/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts -s (2) 1 Simple Avro schema artifact. 2 OpenShift route name that exposes Apicurio Registry. io.apicurio apicurio-registry-maven-plugin ${apicurio.version} generate-sources register (1) http://REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2 (2) TestGroup (3) FullNameRecord ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/schemas/record.avsc FAIL TestGroup ExampleAPI (4) GRAPHQL ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/apis/example.graphql RETURN_OR_UPDATE true 1 Specify register as the execution goal to upload the schema artifact to the registry. 2 Specify the Apicurio Registry URL with the ../apis/registry/v2 endpoint. 3 Specify the Apicurio Registry artifact group ID. 4 You can upload multiple artifacts using the specified group ID, artifact ID, and location.

Additional resources For an open source example of how to use and customize the Apicurio Registry client, see the Apicurio Registry REST client demonstration. For details on how to use the Apicurio Registry Kafka client serializers/deserializers (SerDes) in producer and consumer applications, see Validating schemas using Kafka client serializers/deserializers in Java clients. The Apicurio Registry Java client includes the following configuration options, based on the client factory: Table 1. Apicurio Registry Java client configuration options Option Description Arguments Plain client Basic REST client used to interact with a running Apicurio Registry instance. baseUrl Client with custom configuration Apicurio Registry client using the configuration provided by the user. baseUrl, Map configs Client with custom configuration and authentication Apicurio Registry client that accepts a map containing custom configuration. For example, this is useful to add custom headers to the calls. You must also provide an authentication server to authenticate the requests. baseUrl, Map configs, Auth auth To configure custom headers, you must add the apicurio.registry.request.headers prefix to the configs map key. For example, a configs map key of apicurio.registry.request.headers.Authorization with a value of Basic: YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1 sets the Authorization header with the same value. You can configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication for the Apicurio Registry Java client using the following properties: apicurio.registry.request.ssl.truststore.location apicurio.registry.request.ssl.truststore.password apicurio.registry.request.ssl.truststore.type apicurio.registry.request.ssl.keystore.location apicurio.registry.request.ssl.keystore.password apicurio.registry.request.ssl.keystore.type apicurio.registry.request.ssl.key.password Additional resources For details on how to configure authentication for Apicurio Registry Kafka client serializers/deserializers (SerDes), see Validating schemas using Kafka client serializers/deserializers in Java clients.","title":"Managing Apicurio Registry content using a Java client","component":"apicurio-registry","version":"2.5.x","name":"assembly-using-the-registry-client","url":"/apicurio-registry/2.5.x/getting-started/assembly-using-the-registry-client.html","titles":[{"text":"Apicurio Registry Java client","id":"registry-client-intro_registry"},{"text":"Writing Apicurio Registry Java client applications","id":"writing-registry-client_registry"},{"text":"Apicurio Registry Java client configuration","id":"registry-client-config_registry"},{"text":"Custom header configuration","id":"_custom_header_configuration"},{"text":"TLS configuration options","id":"_tls_configuration_options"}]},"/apicurio-registry/2.5.x/getting-started/guide-exporting-registry-kafka-topic-data.html":{"text":"One of the supported Apicurio Registry storage options is Apache Kafka, which uses a Kafka topic named kafkasql-journal to store data. If you encounter a problem when using this storage option and want to report it to Apicurio Registry developers, you might need to provide an export of the data present in the kafkasql-journal topic for analysis. This document contains information on how to create such a topic export using the kcat tool (formerly known as kafkacat). Prerequisites Kafka has been installed and is running in your environment. You have deployed Apicurio Registry with data stored in the kafkasql-journal topic. The kafkasql-journal topic is still present. Prerequisites Your environment is Kubernetes. You have logged in to the cluster using the kubectl command line interface. Procedure Select a namespace where an ephemeral work pod will be started. This can be the same or a different namespace from where the Kafka cluster is deployed: kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=default Create an ephemeral work pod using the latest Fedora image, and connect to the pod using your terminal: kubectl run work-pod -it --rm --image=fedora --restart=Never If you keep the --rm flag, the work pod will be deleted when you disconnect from the remote terminal. You can install kcat using the dnf package manager. However, that version does not have JSON support enabled. Because you want to export the topic data in a JSON format with additional metadata, you must build the kcat executable from source. In addition, while the kcat project is widely used for this use case, this project seems to be hibernated, and you require an additional feature for the kafkasql-journal topic export to work properly. This feature is support for base64 encoded keys and values, and is important because the topic includes raw binary data, which might not be correctly encoded in the JSON output.Therefore, you must build kcat from source that includes base64 support, which has not been merged into the main project yet. Install git, and check out the kcat repository: dnf install -y git git clone https://github.com/edenhill/kcat.git git remote add jjlin https://github.com/jjlin/kcat.git cd kcat git checkout jjlin/base64 Install the dependencies and build kcat: dnf install -y gcc librdkafka-devel yajl-devel ./configure make Copy the executable to /usr/bin so that it is available in $PATH: cp kcat /usr/bin Configure environment variables that will be used in subsequent examples: export KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=\"my-kafka-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.default.svc:9092\" If you do not require JSON support, you can use the following commands to install kcat using dnf: dnf install -y \"dnf-command(copr)\" dnf copr enable bvn13/kcat dnf update dnf install -y kafkacat The following are several examples of how to use kcat, including creation of a topic export: List Kafka topics: kcat -b $KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER -L | grep \"topic \" | sed 's#\\([^\"]*\"\\)\\([^\"]*\\)\\(\".*\\)#\\2#' The sed command filters out extra information in this example. Export data from the kafkasql-journal topic in JSON format, with envelope, and base64 encoded keys and values: kcat -b $KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER -C -t kafkasql-journal -S base64 -Z -D \\\\n -e -J \\ > kafkasql-journal.topicdump Create an export file for each listed topic by combining the preceding commands: mkdir dump for t in $(kcat -b $KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER -L | grep \"topic \" | sed 's#\\([^\"]*\"\\)\\([^\"]*\\)\\(\".*\\)#\\2#'); do \\ kcat -b $KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER -C -t $t -S base64 -Z -D \\\\n -e -J > dump/$t.topicdump; \\ done After the topic export files have been created, you can run the following command on your local machine to copy the files from the work pod: kubectl cp work-pod:/kcat/dump . To import kafkasql-journal topic data that has been created with kcat, use an application from the Apicurio Registry examples repository as follows: git clone https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-registry-examples.git cd apicurio-registry-examples/tools/kafkasql-topic-import mvn clean install export VERSION=$(mvn help:evaluate -Dexpression=project.version -q -DforceStdout) java -jar target/apicurio-registry-tools-kafkasql-topic-import-$VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar -b -f Additional resources For more details about kcat, see the kcat repository. You can provide additional parameters to configure kcat for accessing Kafka, in the -X property=value format.

If you are deploying to Kubernetes, you can use command line tools to install Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), and instruct it to deploy the Apicurio Registry or other Operators. Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to a Kubernetes cluster. Procedure Go to OperatorHub.io - Apicurio Registry page. Select the Version you want to install Read the information about the Operator, and click Install. Follow the instructions on the installation page. The recommended way to install Apicurio Registry Operator is to use the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which can automatically manage the Operator deployment and upgrades. Apicurio Registry Operator is released to the OperatorHub, so if your cluster has the OLM and OperatorHub installed, the cluster administrator can use the OpenShift web console to deploy the Apicurio Registry Operator: Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to an OpenShift cluster. Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Create a new OpenShift project: In the left navigation menu, click Home > Project > Create Project. Enter a project name, for example, my-project, and click Create. In the left navigation menu, click Operators > OperatorHub. In the Filter by keyword text box, enter registry to find the Apicurio Registry Operator. Read the information about the Operator, and click Install. This displays the Create Operator Subscription page. Select your subscription settings, for example: Installation Mode > A specific namespace on the cluster > my-project Update Channel > 2.x Approval Strategy > Automatic Click Subscribe. This displays the Operators > Installed Operators page. Wait a few moments until the Status for the Apicurio Registry Operator displays Succeeded and the subscription is Up to Date. Additional resources Adding Operators to an OpenShift cluster The recommended Kafka storage option requires that you provide connection information to a Kafka cluster. You can use any Kafka cluster with Kafka support. However, it is recommended to use the Strimzi Operator to provide and maintain a Kafka cluster for you. If you do not already have Kafka installed, you can install the Strimzi Operator on your OpenShift cluster from the OperatorHub. Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to an OpenShift cluster Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Change to the OpenShift project in which Apicurio Registry is installed. For example, from the Project drop-down, select my-project. In the left navigation menu, click Operators > OperatorHub. In the Filter by keyword text box, enter Strimzi to find the Strimzi Operator. Read the information about the Operator, and click Install. This displays the Create Operator Subscription page. Select your subscription settings, for example: Installation Mode > A specific namespace on the cluster > my-project Update Channel > stable Approval Strategy > Manual Click Subscribe. This displays the Operators > Installed Operators page. Wait a few moments until the Status for the Strimzi Operator displays Succeeded and the subscription is Up to Date. Additional resources Adding Operators to an OpenShift cluster Using AMQ Streams on OpenShift One of the available storage options requires that you provide connection information to a PostgreSQL database. You can use any PostgreSQL database available on your OpenShift cluster, but it is recommended to use OperatorHub to choose and install an Operator that can manage a PostgreSQL database for you. You can install your preferred PostgresQL Operator, but this section shows how to install the PostgreSQL Operator by Dev4Ddevs.com and create a new database for Apicurio Registry. Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to an OpenShift cluster. Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Change to the OpenShift project in which Apicurio Registry is installed. For example, from the Project drop-down, select my-project. In the left navigation menu, click Operators > OperatorHub. In the Filter by keyword text box, enter PostgreSQL to find an Operator suitable for your environment, for example, PostgreSQL Operator by Dev4Ddevs.com or Crunchy PostgreSQL for OpenShift. Read the information about the Operator, and click Install. This displays the Create Operator Subscription page. Select your subscription settings, for example: Installation Mode: Select one of the following: All namespaces on the cluster (default) A specific namespace on the cluster and then my-project Update Channel > stable Approval Strategy: Select Automatic or Manual Click Subscribe. This displays the Operators > Installed Operators page. Wait a few moments until the Status for the PostgreSQL Operator displays Succeeded and the subscription is Up to Date. You must read the documentation from your chosen PostgreSQL Operator for details on how to create and manage your database. Create a PostgreSQL database for your Apicurio Registry storage. For example, click Installed Operators > PostgreSQL Operator by Dev4Ddevs.com > Create database > YAML.

You can update these by setting an environment variable on the Apicurio Registry Deployment resource. If the specific configuration option is not available in the ApicurioRegistry CR, you can use an environment variable to adjust it. Procedure OpenShift web console Select the Installed Operators tab, and then the Red Hat Integration - Apicurio Registry Operator. On the Apicurio Registry tab, click the ApicurioRegistry CR for your Apicurio Registry deployment. On the main overview page, view the managedResources section, which contains the name of the Deployment managed by the Operator to deploy your Apicurio Registry instance. Find that Deployment in the Workloads > Deployments in the left menu. Select the Deployment with the correct name, and select the Environment tab. You can add or modify your environment variable to the Single values (env) section. Click Save at the bottom. OpenShift CLI Select the project where Apicurio Registry is installed. Run oc get apicurioregistry to get the list of ApicurioRegistry CRs Run oc describe on the CR representing the Apicurio Registry instance that you want to configure. View the managedResource in the status section. Find that Deployment and enter oc edit. Add or modify the environment variable in the spec.template.spec.containers[0].env section. Apicurio Registry provides readiness and liveness probes for OpenShift to ensure application health. These settings are configured to use reasonable defaults, but if you want to adjust them, this section provides details on the environment variables that you can configure. OpenShift liveness and readiness errors are explained as follows: Liveness error - the application cannot make progress, OpenShift restarts the failing pod. Readiness error - the application is not ready, for example, it is overwhelmed by requests. OpenShift stops sending requests to the pod for the time the probe fails. If other pods are OK, they still receive requests. Table 2. Apicurio Registry liveness environment variables Name Value type Description LIVENESS_ERROR_THRESHOLD Positive integer Number of liveness errors that can occur before the liveness probe fails. LIVENESS_COUNTER_RESET Positive integer, seconds Period in which the threshold number of errors must occur. For example, if this value is 60 and the threshold is 1, the check fails after two errors occur in 1 minute. LIVENESS_STATUS_RESET Positive integer, seconds Number of seconds that must elapse without any more errors for the liveness probe to reset to OK status. Because OpenShift restarts the pod that fails the liveness check, this value, unlike readiness, does not actually affect what happens. LIVENESS_ERRORS_IGNORED Comma-separated list of fully qualified exception class names. List of errors that are ignored for liveness checking purposes. Table 3. Apicurio Registry readiness environment variables Name Value type Description READINESS_ERROR_THRESHOLD Positive integer Number of readiness errors that can occur before the readiness probe fails. READINESS_COUNTER_RESET Positive integer, seconds Period in which the threshold number of errors must occur. For example, if this value is 60 and the threshold is 1, the check fails after two errors occur in 1 minute. READINESS_STATUS_RESET Positive integer, seconds Number of seconds that must elapse without any more errors for the readiness probe to reset to OK status. In practice, this value means how long the pod remains in an unready state until it returns to normal operation. READINESS_TIMEOUT positive integer, seconds The readiness system tracks the timeout of two operations: how long it takes for a storage request to complete, and how long it takes for an HTTP REST API request to return a response. If the operation takes more time, it is counted as a readiness error. This value controls those timeouts. The following procedure shows how to configure Apicurio Registry deployment to expose a port for HTTPS connections from inside the OpenShift cluster. This kind of connection is not directly available outside of the cluster. Routing is based on hostname, which is encoded in the case of an HTTPS connection. Therefore, edge termination or other configuration is still needed. See Configuring an HTTPS connection to Apicurio Registry from outside the OpenShift cluster. Prerequisites You must have already installed the Apicurio Registry Operator. Procedure Generate a keystore with a self-signed certificate. You can skip this step if you are using your own certificates. keytool -genkey -trustcacerts -keyalg RSA -keystore registry-keystore.jks -storepass password Create a new secret to hold the keystore and keystore password. In the left navigation menu of the OpenShift web console, click Workloads > Secrets > Create Key/Value Secret. Use the following values: Name: registry-keystore Key 1: keystore.jks Value 1: registry-keystore.jks (uploaded file) Key 2: password Value 2: password If you encounter a java.io.IOException: Invalid keystore format, the upload of the binary file did not work properly. As an alternative, encode the file as a base64 string using cat registry-keystore.jks | base64 -w0 > data.txt and edit the Secret resource as yaml to manually add the encoded file. Edit the Deployment resource of the Apicurio Registry instance. You can find the correct name in a status field of the Apicurio Registry Operator. Add the keystore secret as a volume: template: spec: volumes: - name: registry-keystore-secret-volume secret: secretName: registry-keystore Add a volume mount: volumeMounts: - name: registry-keystore-secret-volume mountPath: /etc/registry-keystore readOnly: true Add JAVA_OPTIONS and KEYSTORE_PASSWORD environment variables: - name: KEYSTORE_PASSWORD valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: registry-keystore key: password - name: JAVA_OPTIONS value: >- -Dquarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-file=/etc/registry-keystore/keystore.jks -Dquarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-file-type=jks -Dquarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-password=$(KEYSTORE_PASSWORD) Order is important when using string interpolation. Enable the HTTPS port: ports: - containerPort: 8080 protocol: TCP - containerPort: 8443 protocol: TCP Edit the Service resource of the Apicurio Registry instance. You can find the correct name in a status field of the Apicurio Registry Operator. ports: - name: http protocol: TCP port: 8080 targetPort: 8080 - name: https protocol: TCP port: 8443 targetPort: 8443 Verify that the connection is working: Connect into a pod on the cluster using SSH (you can use the Apicurio Registry pod): oc rsh -n default example-apicurioregistry-deployment-vx28s-4-lmtqb Find the cluster IP of the Apicurio Registry pod from the Service resource (see the Location column in the web console). Afterwards, execute a test request (we are using self-signed certificate, so an insecure flag is required): curl -k https://172.30.209.198:8443/health [...] The following procedure shows how to configure Apicurio Registry deployment to expose an HTTPS edge-terminated route for connections from outside the OpenShift cluster. Prerequisites You must have already installed the Apicurio Registry Operator. Read the OpenShift documentation for creating secured routes. Procedure Add a second Route in addition to the HTTP route created by the Apicurio Registry Operator. See the following example: kind: Route apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1 metadata: [...] labels: app: example-apicurioregistry [...] spec: host: example-apicurioregistry-default.apps.example.com to: kind: Service name: example-apicurioregistry-service-9whd7 weight: 100 port: targetPort: 8080 tls: termination: edge insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect wildcardPolicy: None Make sure the insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect configuration property is set. If you do not specify a certificate, OpenShift will use a default. You can alternatively generate a custom self-signed certificate using the following commands: openssl genrsa 2048 > host.key && openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -key host.key -out host.cert and then create a route using the OpenShift CLI: oc create route edge \\ --service=example-apicurioregistry-service-9whd7 \\ --cert=host.cert --key=host.key \\ --hostname=example-apicurioregistry-default.apps.example.com \\ --insecure-policy=Redirect \\ -n default When using storage in a PostgreSQL database, you must ensure that the data stored by Apicurio Registry is backed up regularly. SQL Dump is a simple procedure that works with any PostgreSQL installation. This uses the pg_dump utility to generate a file with SQL commands that you can use to recreate the database in the same state that it was in at the time of the dump. pg_dump is a regular PostgreSQL client application, which you can execute from any remote host that has access to the database. Like any other client, the operations that can perform are limited to the user permissions. Procedure Use the pg_dump command to redirect the output to a file: $ pg_dump dbname > dumpfile You can specify the database server that pg_dump connects to using the -h host and -p port options. You can reduce large dump files using a compression tool, such as gzip, for example: $ pg_dump dbname | gzip > filename.gz Additional resources For details on client authentication, see the PostgreSQL documentation. For details on importing and exporting registry content, see Managing Apicurio Registry content using the REST API. You can restore SQL Dump files created by pg_dump using the psql utility. Prerequisites You must have already backed up your PostgreSQL datbase using pg_dump. See Backing up Apicurio Registry PostgreSQL storage. All users who own objects or have permissions on objects in the dumped database must already exist. Procedure Enter the following command to create the database: $ createdb -T template0 dbname Enter the following command to restore the SQL dump $ psql dbname < dumpfile Run ANALYZE on each database so the query optimizer has useful statistics.","title":"Configuring and managing Apicurio Registry deployment","component":"apicurio-registry-operator","version":"1.0.0","name":"assembly-registry-maintenance","url":"/apicurio-registry-operator/1.0.0/assembly-registry-maintenance.html","titles":[{"text":"Securing Apicurio Registry using the Keycloak Operator","id":"registry-security-keycloak"},{"text":"Managing Apicurio Registry environment variables","id":"manage-registry-environment-variables"},{"text":"Apicurio Registry liveness and readiness environment variables","id":"registry-liveness-and-readiness"},{"text":"Configuring an HTTPS connection to Apicurio Registry from inside the OpenShift cluster","id":"registry-https-in-cluster"},{"text":"Configuring an HTTPS connection to Apicurio Registry from outside the OpenShift cluster","id":"registry-https-outside-cluster"},{"text":"Backing up Apicurio Registry PostgreSQL storage","id":"registry-sql-backup"},{"text":"Restoring Apicurio Registry PostgreSQL storage","id":"registry-sql-restore"}]},"/apicurio-registry-operator/1.0.0/assembly-registry-storage.html":{"text":"This chapter explains how to configure the available Apicurio Registry storage options: Apicurio Registry storage options Configuring Apicurio Registry In-Memory storage using CLI Configuring plain Kafka storage with no security Configuring Kafka storage with TLS security Configuring Kafka storage with SCRAM security Configuring SQL (PostgreSQL) storage This chapter mostly focuses on storage configuration procedures for OpenShift using OperatorHub UI. If you are deploying to Kubernetes, you can use command line tools to perform the equivalent steps. The Apicurio Registry Operator supports the same configuration options on OpenShift and Kubernetes. The main decision to make when deploying Apicurio Registry is which storage backend to use. The following storage options are available: In-memory - data is stored in RAM on each Apicurio Registry node. This is the easiest deployment to use, but is not recommended for production environment. Apache Kafka (Kafka + SQL) - data is stored using Apache Kafka, with the help of local SQL database on each node. SQL (PostgreSQL) - data is stored in a relational database, in this case PostgreSQL 12+. Storage requiring installation The following options require that the storage is already installed as a prerequisite: Apache Kafka SQL (PostgreSQL) Additional resources Installing Apicurio Registry Operator using the OperatorHub The in-memory storage option uses RAM to store the data on nodes where Apicurio Registry is deployed, and it is the simplest persistence option to use. The Apicurio Registry Operator will deploy Apicurio Registry in this way if you do not provide any configuration in the ApicurioRegistry CR: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry metadata: name: example-apicurioregistry-mem spec: configuration: persistence: \"mem\" # Optional (default value) # NOTE: No additional configuration required for *dev* deployment Prerequisites You must have an Kubernetes cluster with cluster administrator access. You must have already installed the Apicurio Registry Operator. Procedure Deploy the example CR using following commands: export NAMESPACE=\"default\" curl -sSL \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apicurio/apicurio-registry-operator/v1.0.0/docs/modules/ROOT/examples/apicurioregistry_mem_cr.yaml\" | kubectl apply -f - -n $NAMESPACE This persistence option does not support data distribution across Apicurio Registry nodes. Therefore, it is only recommended for development environments using a single replica (Pod). Use embedded Infinispan persistence option when deploying multiple replicas. You can configure the Strimzi Operator and Apicurio Registry Operator to use a default connection with no security. Prerequisites You must install the Apicurio Registry Operator using the OperatorHub or command line. You must install the Strimzi Operator or have Kafka accessible from your OpenShift cluster. Procedure In the OpenShift web console, click Installed Operators, select the Strimzi Operator details, and then the Kafka tab. Click Create Kafka to provision a new Kafka cluster for Apicurio Registry storage. You can use the default value, for example: apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2 kind: Kafka metadata: name: my-cluster namespace: registry-example-kafkasql-plain # Change or remove the explicit namespace spec: kafka: config: offsets.topic.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.min.isr: 2 log.message.format.version: '2.7' inter.broker.protocol.version: '2.7' version: 2.7.0 storage: type: ephemeral replicas: 3 listeners: - name: plain port: 9092 type: internal tls: false - name: tls port: 9093 type: internal tls: true entityOperator: topicOperator: {} userOperator: {} zookeeper: storage: type: ephemeral replicas: 3 Your OpenShift project namespace might be different. When the cluster is ready, open the Kafka resource, examine the status block, and copy the bootstrapServers value for later use when deploying Apicurio Registry. For example: status: conditions: ... listeners: - addresses: - host: my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.registry-example-kafkasql-plain.svc port: 9092 bootstrapServers: 'my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.registry-example-kafkasql-plain.svc:9092' type: plain ... The default Kafka topic name that Apicurio Registry uses to store data is kafkasql-journal. This topic is created automatically by Apicurio Registry. You can override this behavior or the default topic name by setting the appropriate environment variables (default values): REGISTRY_KAFKASQL_TOPIC_AUTO_CREATE=true REGISTRY_KAFKASQL_TOPIC=kafkasql-journal If you decide not to create the Kafka topic manually, skip the next step. Click the Kafka Topic tab, and then Create Kafka Topic to create the kafkasql-journal topic: apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1 kind: KafkaTopic metadata: name: kafkasql-journal labels: strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster namespace: registry-example-kafkasql-plain spec: partitions: 2 replicas: 1 config: retention.ms: 604800000 segment.bytes: 1073741824 Select the Apicurio Registry Operator, and in the ApicurioRegistry tab, click Create ApicurioRegistry, using the following example, but replace your value in the bootstrapServers field. apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry metadata: name: example-apicurioregistry-kafkasql spec: configuration: persistence: \"kafkasql\" kafkasql: bootstrapServers: \"my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.registry-example-kafkasql-plain.svc:9092\" Wait a few minutes to see the Route being created, where you can access the application. You can configure the Strimzi Operator and Apicurio Registry Operator to use an encrypted Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection. Prerequisites You must install the Apicurio Registry Operator using the OperatorHub or command line. You must install the Strimzi Operator or have Kafka accessible from your OpenShift cluster. This section assumes that the Strimzi Operator is available, however you can use any Kafka deployment. In that case, you must manually create the Openshift secrets that the Apicurio Registry Operator expects. Procedure In the OpenShift web console, click Installed Operators, select the Strimzi Operator details, and then the Kafka tab. Click Create Kafka to provision a new Kafka cluster for Apicurio Registry storage. Configure the authorization and tls fields to use TLS authentication for the Kafka cluster, for example: apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2 kind: Kafka metadata: name: my-cluster namespace: registry-example-kafkasql-tls # Change or remove the explicit namespace spec: kafka: config: offsets.topic.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.min.isr: 2 log.message.format.version: '2.7' inter.broker.protocol.version: '2.7' version: 2.7.0 storage: type: ephemeral replicas: 3 listeners: - name: tls port: 9093 type: internal tls: true authentication: type: tls authorization: type: simple entityOperator: topicOperator: {} userOperator: {} zookeeper: storage: type: ephemeral replicas: 3 The default Kafka topic name that Apicurio Registry uses to store data is kafkasql-journal.

You can specify a user name in the metadata section or use the default my-user. apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1 kind: KafkaUser metadata: name: my-user labels: strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster namespace: registry-example-kafkasql-tls spec: authentication: type: tls authorization: acls: - operation: All resource: name: '*' patternType: literal type: topic - operation: All resource: name: '*' patternType: literal type: cluster - operation: All resource: name: '*' patternType: literal type: transactionalId - operation: All resource: name: '*' patternType: literal type: group type: simple You must configure the authorization specifically for the topics and resources that the Apicurio Registry requires. This is a simple permissive example. Click Workloads and then Secrets to find two secrets that Strimzi creates for Apicurio Registry to connect to the Kafka cluster: my-cluster-cluster-ca-cert - contains the PKCS12 truststore for the Kafka cluster my-user - contains the user’s keystore The name of the secret can vary based on your cluster or user name. If you create the secrets manually, they must contain the following key-value pairs: my-cluster-ca-cert ca.p12 - truststore in PKCS12 format ca.password - truststore password my-user user.p12 - keystore in PKCS12 format user.password - keystore password Configure the following example configuration to deploy the Apicurio Registry. apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry metadata: name: example-apicurioregistry-kafkasql spec: configuration: persistence: \"kafkasql\" kafkasql: bootstrapServers: \"my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.registry-example-kafkasql-tls.svc:9093\" security: tls: keystoreSecretName: my-user truststoreSecretName: my-cluster-cluster-ca-cert You must use a different bootstrapServers address than in the plain insecure use case. The address must support TLS connections and is found in the specified Kafka resource under the type: tls field. You can configure the Strimzi Operator and Apicurio Registry Operator to use Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM-SHA-512) for the Kafka cluster. Prerequisites You must install the Apicurio Registry Operator using the OperatorHub or command line. You must install the Strimzi Operator or have Kafka accessible from your OpenShift cluster.
