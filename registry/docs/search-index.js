Apicurio Registry SerDes are based on the SchemaResolver interface, which abstracts access to the registry and applies the same lookup logic for the SerDes classes of all supported formats. Table 1. Configuration property for SchemaResolver interface Constant Property Description Type Default SCHEMA_RESOLVER apicurio.registry.schema-resolver Used by serializers and deserializers. Fully-qualified Java classname that implements SchemaResolver. String io.apicurio.registry.resolver.DefaultSchemaResolver The DefaultSchemaResolver is recommended and provides useful features for most use cases. For some advanced use cases, you might use a custom implementation of SchemaResolver. You can use the DefaultSchemaResolver to configure features such as: Access to the registry API How to look up artifacts in the registry How to write and read artifact information to and from Kafka Fall-back options for deserializers The DefaultSchemaResolver provides the following properties to configure access to the core registry API: Table 2. Configuration properties for access to registry API Constant Property Description Type Default REGISTRY_URL apicurio.registry.url Used by serializers and deserializers. URL to access the registry API. String None AUTH_SERVICE_URL apicurio.auth.service.url Used by serializers and deserializers. URL of the authentication service. Required when accessing a secure registry using the OAuth client credentials flow. String None AUTH_REALM apicurio.auth.realm Used by serializers and deserializers. Realm to access the authentication service. Required when accessing a secure registry using the OAuth client credentials flow. String None AUTH_CLIENT_ID apicurio.auth.client.id Used by serializers and deserializers. Client ID to access the authentication service. Required when accessing a secure registry using the OAuth client credentials flow. String None AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET apicurio.auth.client.secret Used by serializers and deserializers. Client secret to access the authentication service. Required when accessing a secure registry using the OAuth client credentials flow. String None AUTH_USERNAME apicurio.auth.username Used by serializers and deserializers. Username to access the registry. Required when accessing a secure registry using HTTP basic authentication. String None AUTH_PASSWORD apicurio.auth.password Used by serializers and deserializers. Password to access the registry. Required when accessing a secure registry using HTTP basic authentication. String None The DefaultSchemaResolver uses the following properties to configure how to look up artifacts in Apicurio Registry. Table 3. Configuration properties for registry artifact lookup Constant Property Description Type Default ARTIFACT_RESOLVER_STRATEGY apicurio.registry.artifact-resolver-strategy Used by serializers only. Fully-qualified Java classname that implements ArtifactReferenceResolverStrategy and maps each Kafka message to an ArtifactReference (groupId, artifactId, and version). For example, the default strategy uses the topic name as the schema artifactId. String io.apicurio.registry.serde.strategy.TopicIdStrategy EXPLICIT_ARTIFACT_GROUP_ID apicurio.registry.artifact.group-id Used by serializers only. Sets the groupId used for querying or creating an artifact. Overrides the groupId returned by the ArtifactResolverStrategy. String None EXPLICIT_ARTIFACT_ID apicurio.registry.artifact.artifact-id Used by serializers only. Sets the artifactId used for querying or creating an artifact. Overrides the artifactId returned by the ArtifactResolverStrategy. String None EXPLICIT_ARTIFACT_VERSION apicurio.registry.artifact.version Used by serializers only. Sets the artifact version used for querying or creating an artifact. Overrides the version returned by the ArtifactResolverStrategy. String None FIND_LATEST_ARTIFACT apicurio.registry.find-latest Used by serializers only. Specifies whether the serializer tries to find the latest artifact in the registry for the corresponding group ID and artifact ID. boolean false AUTO_REGISTER_ARTIFACT apicurio.registry.auto-register Used by serializers only. Specifies whether the serializer tries to create an artifact in the registry. The JSON Schema serializer does not support this feature. boolean false AUTO_REGISTER_ARTIFACT_IF_EXISTS apicurio.registry.auto-register.if-exists Used by serializers only. Configures the behavior of the client when there is a conflict creating an artifact because the artifact already exists. Available values are FAIL, UPDATE, RETURN, or RETURN_OR_UPDATE. String RETURN_OR_UPDATE CHECK_PERIOD_MS apicurio.registry.check-period-ms Used by serializers and deserializers. Specifies how long to cache artifacts before auto-eviction. If not set, artifacts are fetched every time. String None USE_ID apicurio.registry.use-id Used by serializers and deserializers. Configures to use the specified IdOption as the identifier for artifacts. Options are globalId and contentId. Instructs the serializer to write the specified ID to Kafka, and instructs the deserializer to use this ID to find the schema. String globalId The DefaultSchemaResolver uses the following properties to configure how artifact information is written to and read from Kafka. Table 4. Configuration properties to read/write artifact information in Kafka Constant Property Description Type Default ENABLE_HEADERS apicurio.registry.headers.enabled Used by serializers and deserializers. Configures to read/write the artifact identifier to Kafka message headers instead of in the message payload. boolean true HEADERS_HANDLER apicurio.registry.headers.handler Used by serializers and deserializers.

Sets the artifactId used as fallback for resolving the artifact used for deserialization. String None FALLBACK_ARTIFACT_GROUP_ID apicurio.registry.fallback.group-id Used by deserializers only. Sets the groupId used as fallback for resolving the group used for deserialization. String None FALLBACK_ARTIFACT_VERSION apicurio.registry.fallback.version Used by deserializers only. Sets the version used as fallback for resolving the artifact used for deserialization. String None Additional resources For more details, see the SerdeConfig Java class You can configure application properties as Java system properties or include them in the Quarkus application.properties file. For more details, see the Quarkus documentation. When using schemas in your Kafka client applications, you must choose which specific schema type to use, depending on your use case. Apicurio Registry provides SerDe Java classes for Apache Avro, JSON Schema, and Google Protobuf. The following sections explain how to configure Kafka applications to use each type. You can also use Kafka to implement custom serializer and deserializer classes, and leverage Apicurio Registry functionality using the Apicurio Registry REST Java client. Using the SerDe classes provided by Apicurio Registry in your Kafka application involves setting the correct configuration properties. The following simple Avro examples show how to configure a serializer in a Kafka producer application and how to configure a deserializer in a Kafka consumer application. Example serializer configuration in a Kafka producer // Create the Kafka producer private static Producer createKafkaProducer() { Properties props = new Properties(); // Configure standard Kafka settings props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, SERVERS); props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.CLIENT_ID_CONFIG, \"Producer-\" + TOPIC_NAME); props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.ACKS_CONFIG, \"all\"); // Use Apicurio Registry-provided Kafka serializer for Avro props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName()); props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, AvroKafkaSerializer.class.getName()); // Configure the Apicurio Registry location props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.REGISTRY_URL, REGISTRY_URL); // Register the schema artifact if not found in the registry. props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.AUTO_REGISTER_ARTIFACT, Boolean.TRUE); // Create the Kafka producer Producer producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props); return producer; } Example deserializer configuration in a Kafka consumer // Create the Kafka consumer private static KafkaConsumer createKafkaConsumer() { Properties props = new Properties(); // Configure standard Kafka settings props.putIfAbsent(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, SERVERS); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, \"Consumer-\" + TOPIC_NAME); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG, \"true\"); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_COMMIT_INTERVAL_MS_CONFIG, \"1000\"); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, \"earliest\"); // Use Apicurio Registry-provided Kafka deserializer for Avro props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName()); props.putIfAbsent(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, AvroKafkaDeserializer.class.getName()); // Configure the Apicurio Registry location props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.REGISTRY_URL, REGISTRY_URL); // No other configuration needed because the schema globalId the deserializer uses is sent // in the payload. The deserializer extracts the globalId and uses it to look up the schema // from the registry. // Create the Kafka consumer KafkaConsumer consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props); return consumer; } Additional resources For an example application, see the Simple Avro example Apicurio Registry provides the following Kafka client serializer and deserializer classes for Apache Avro: io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro.AvroKafkaSerializer io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro.AvroKafkaDeserializer Configure the Avro serializer You can configure the Avro serializer class with the following: Apicurio Registry URL Artifact resolver strategy ID location ID encoding Avro datum provider Avro encoding ID location The serializer passes the unique ID of the schema as part of the Kafka message so that consumers can use the correct schema for deserialization. The ID can be in the message payload or in the message headers. The default location is the message payload. To send the ID in the message headers, set the following configuration property: props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.ENABLE_HEADERS, \"true\") The property name is apicurio.registry.headers.enabled. ID encoding You can customize how the schema ID is encoded when passing it in the Kafka message body. Set the apicurio.registry.id-handler configuration property to a class that implements the io.apicurio.registry.serde.IdHandler interface. Apicurio Registry provides the following implementations: io.apicurio.registry.serde.DefaultIdHandler: Stores the ID as an 8-byte long io.apicurio.registry.serde.Legacy4ByteIdHandler: Stores the ID as an 4-byte integer Apicurio Registry represents the schema ID as a long, but for legacy reasons, or for compatibility with other registries or SerDe classes, you might want to use 4 bytes when sending the ID. Avro datum provider Avro provides different datum writers and readers to write and read data. Apicurio Registry supports three different types: Generic Specific Reflect The Apicurio Registry AvroDatumProvider is the abstraction of which type is used, where DefaultAvroDatumProvider is used by default. You can set the following configuration options: apicurio.registry.avro-datum-provider: Specifies a fully-qualified Java class name of the AvroDatumProvider implementation, for example io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro.ReflectAvroDatumProvider apicurio.registry.use-specific-avro-reader: Set to true to use a specific type when using DefaultAvroDatumProvider Avro encoding When using Avro to serialize data, you can use the Avro binary encoding format to ensure the data is encoded in as efficient a format as possible. Avro also supports encoding the data as JSON, which makes it easier to inspect the payload of each message, for example, for logging or debugging. You can set the Avro encoding by configuring the apicurio.registry.avro.encoding property with a value of JSON or BINARY. The default is BINARY. Configure the Avro deserializer You must configure the Avro deserializer class to match the following configuration settings of the serializer: Apicurio Registry URL ID encoding Avro datum provider Avro encoding See the serializer section for these configuration options. The property names and values are the same. The following options are not required when configuring the deserializer: Artifact resolver strategy ID location The deserializer class can determine the values for these options from the message. The strategy is not required because the serializer is responsible for sending the ID as part of the message. The ID location is determined by checking for the magic byte at the start of the message payload. If that byte is found, the ID is read from the message payload using the configured handler. If the magic byte is not found, the ID is read from the message headers. Additional resources For more details on Avro configuration, see the AvroKafkaSerdeConfig Java class For an example application, see the Simple Avro example Apicurio Registry provides the following Kafka client serializer and deserializer classes for JSON Schema: io.apicurio.registry.serde.jsonschema.JsonSchemaKafkaSerializer io.apicurio.registry.serde.jsonschema.JsonSchemaKafkaDeserializer Unlike Apache Avro, JSON Schema is not a serialization technology, but is instead a validation technology. As a result, configuration options for JSON Schema are quite different. For example, there is no encoding option, because data is always encoded as JSON. Configure the JSON Schema serializer You can configure the JSON Schema serializer class as follows: Apicurio Registry URL Artifact resolver strategy Schema validation The only non-standard configuration property is JSON Schema validation, which is enabled by default. You can disable this by setting apicurio.registry.serde.validation-enabled to \"false\". For example: props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.VALIDATION_ENABLED, Boolean.FALSE) Configure the JSON Schema deserializer You can configure the JSON Schema deserializer class as follows: Apicurio Registry URL Schema validation Class for deserializing data You must provide the location of Apicurio Registry so that the schema can be loaded. The other configuration is optional. Deserializer validation only works if the serializer passes the global ID in the Kafka message, which will only happen when validation is enabled in the serializer. Additional resources For more details, see the JsonSchemaKafkaDeserializerConfig Java class For an example application, see the Simple JSON Schema example Apicurio Registry provides the following Kafka client serializer and deserializer classes for Google Protobuf: io.apicurio.registry.serde.protobuf.ProtobufKafkaSerializer io.apicurio.registry.serde.protobuf.ProtobufKafkaDeserializer Configure the Protobuf serializer You can configure the Protobuf serializer class as follows: Apicurio Registry URL Artifact resolver strategy ID location ID encoding Schema validation For details on these configuration options, see the following sections: Apicurio Registry serializer/deserializer configuration in client applications Configure Avro SerDe with Apicurio Registry Configure the Protobuf deserializer You must configure the Protobuf deserializer class to match the following configuration settings in the serializer: Apicurio Registry URL ID encoding The configuration property names and values are the same as for the serializer. The following options are not required when configuring the deserializer: Artifact resolver strategy ID location The deserializer class can determine the values for these options from the message. The strategy is not required because the serializer is responsible for sending the ID as part of the message. The ID location is determined by checking for the magic byte at the start of the message payload. If that byte is found, the ID is read from the message payload using the configured handler. If the magic byte is not found, the ID is read from the message headers. The Protobuf deserializer does not deserialize to your exact Protobuf Message implementation, but rather to a DynamicMessage instance. There is no appropriate API to do otherwise.

Alternatively, for details on how to configure these settings automatically, see the Apicurio Registry Operator documentation. You can enable authentication for the Apicurio Registry web console and core REST API using Keycloak based on OAuth using OpenID Connect (OIDC). The same Keycloak realm and users are federated across the Apicurio Registry web console and core REST API using OpenID Connect so that you only require one set of credentials. Apicurio Registry provides role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles. Apicurio Registry also provides content-based authorization at the schema or API level, where only the creator of the registry artifact can update or delete it. Apicurio Registry authentication and authorization settings are disabled by default. Prerequisites Keycloak is installed and running. For more details, see Keycloak user documentation. Apicurio Registry is installed and running. Procedure In the Keycloak Admin Console, create a Keycloak realm for Apicurio Registry. By default, Apicurio Registry expects a realm name of registry. For more details on creating realms, see Getting Started with Keycloak. Create a Keycloak client for the Apicurio Registry API. By default, Apicurio Registry expects the following settings: Client ID: registry-api Client Protocol: openid-connect Access Type: bearer-only You can use the defaults for the other client settings. If you are using Keycloak service accounts, the client Access Type must be confidential instead of bearer-only. Create a Keycloak client for the Apicurio Registry web console. By default, Apicurio Registry expects the following settings: Client ID: apicurio-registry Client Protocol: openid-connect Access Type: public Valid Redirect URLs: http://my-registry-url:8080/* Web Origins: + You can use the defaults for the other client settings. In your Apicurio Registry deployment on OpenShift, set the following Apicurio Registry environment variables to configure authentication using Keycloak: Table 1. Configuration for Apicurio Registry authentication Environment variable Description Type Default AUTH_ENABLED If set to true, the environment variables that follow are required. String false KEYCLOAK_URL The URL of the Keycloak authentication server to use. Must end with /auth. String None KEYCLOAK_REALM The Keycloak realm used for authentication. String registry KEYCLOAK_API_CLIENT_ID The client ID for the Apicurio Registry REST API. String registry-api KEYCLOAK_UI_CLIENT_ID The client ID for the Apicurio Registry web console. String apicurio-registry For an example of setting environment variables on OpenShift, see Configuring Apicurio Registry health checks on OpenShift. Set the following option to true to enable Apicurio Registry user roles in Keycloak: Table 2. Configuration for Apicurio Registry role-based authorization Environment variable Java system property Type Default value ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_ENABLED registry.auth.role-based-authorization Boolean false When Apicurio Registry user roles are enabled, you must assign Apicurio Registry users to at least one of the following default user roles in your Keycloak realm: Table 3. Default user roles for registry authentication and authorization Role Read artifacts Write artifacts Global rules Summary sr-admin Yes Yes Yes Full access to all create, read, update, and delete operations. sr-developer Yes Yes No Access to create, read, update, and delete operations, except configuring global rules. This role can configure artifact rules. sr-readonly Yes No No Access to read and search operations only. This role cannot configure any rules. Set the following to true to enable owner-only authorization for updates to schema and API artifacts in Apicurio Registry: Table 4. Configuration for owner-only authorization Environment variable Java system property Type Default value REGISTRY_AUTH_OWNER_ONLY_AUTHORIZATION registry.auth.owner-only-authorization Boolean false Additional resources For details on configuring non-default user role names, see Apicurio Registry authentication and authorization configuration options For an open source example application and Keycloak realm, see Docker Compose-based example of using Keycloak with Apicurio Registry For details on how to use Keycloak in a production environment, see the Keycloak documentation For details on custom security configuration, the see Quarkus Open ID Connect documentation Apicurio Registry provides configuration options for authentication using Keycloak with OpenID Connect or using HTTP basic authentication. Apicurio Registry provides configuration options for authorization, including role-based and content-based approaches. These include role-based authorization for default admin, write, and read-only user roles. Apicurio Registry also provides content-based authorization at the schema or API level, where only the creator of the registry artifact can update or delete it. Apicurio Registry authentication and authorization options are disabled by default. You can set the following environment variables to configure authentication for the Apicurio Registry web console and API using Keycloak: Table 5. Configuration for Apicurio Registry authentication options Environment variable Description Type Default AUTH_ENABLED Enables/disables authentication in registry. When set to true, the environment variables that follow are required. String false KEYCLOAK_URL The URL of the Keycloak authentication server to use. Must end with /auth. String - KEYCLOAK_REALM The Keycloak realm used for authentication. String - KEYCLOAK_API_CLIENT_ID The client ID for the Apicurio Registry REST API. String registry-api KEYCLOAK_UI_CLIENT_ID The client ID for the Apicurio Registry web console. String apicurio-registry By default, Apicurio Registry supports authentication using OpenID Connect. Users (or API clients) must obtain an access token to make authenticated calls to the Apicurio Registry REST API. However, because some tools do not support OpenID Connect, you can also configure Apicurio Registry to support HTTP basic authentication by setting the following configuration option to true. Table 6. Configuration for Apicurio Registry to enable HTTP basic authentication support Environment variable Java system property Type Default value CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_BASIC_AUTH_ENABLED registry.auth.basic-auth-client-credentials.enabled Boolean false You can set the following option to true to enable role-based authorization in Apicurio Registry: Table 7. Configuration for Apicurio Registry role-based authorization Environment variable Java system property Type Default value ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_ENABLED registry.auth.role-based-authorization Boolean false You can then configure role-based authorization to use roles found in the user’s authentication token (for example, granted when authenticating using Keycloak), or to use role mappings managed internally by Apicurio Registry. To enable using roles assigned by Keycloak, set the following environment variables: Table 8. Configuration for Apicurio Registry role-based authorization using Keycloak Environment variable Description Type Default ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_SOURCE When set to token, user roles are taken from the authentication token. String token REGISTRY_AUTH_ROLES_ADMIN The name of the role that indicates a user is an admin. String sr-admin REGISTRY_AUTH_ROLES_DEVELOPER The name of the role that indicates a user is a developer. String sr-developer REGISTRY_AUTH_ROLES_READONLY The name of the role that indicates a user has read-only access. String sr-readonly When Apicurio Registry is configured to use roles from Keycloak, you must assign Apicurio Registry users to at least one of the following user roles in Keycloak. However, you can configure different user role names using the environment variables in the table above: Table 9. Apicurio Registry roles for authentication and authorization Role name Read artifacts Write artifacts Global rules Description sr-admin Yes Yes Yes Full access to all create, read, update, and delete operations. sr-developer Yes Yes No Access to create, read, update, and delete operations, except configuring global rules and import/export. This role can configure artifact rules only. sr-readonly Yes No No Access to read and search operations only. This role cannot configure any rules. To enable using roles managed internally by Apicurio Registry, set the following environment variables: Table 10. Configuration for Apicurio Registry role-based authorization using internal role mappings Environment variable Description Type Default ROLE_BASED_AUTHZ_SOURCE When set to application, user are managed internally by Apicurio Registry. String token When using internally managed role mappings, users can be assigned a role using the /admin/roleMappings endpoint in the Apicurio Registry REST API. For more details, see Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. Users can be granted exactly one role: ADMIN, DEVELOPER, or READ_ONLY. Only users with admin privileges can grant access to other users. Because there are no default admin users in Apicurio Registry, it is usually helpful to configure another way for users to be identified as admins. You can configure this admin-override feature using the following environment variables: Table 11. Configuration for Apicurio Registry admin-override Environment variable Description Type Default REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_ENABLED Enables the admin-override feature. String false REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_FROM Where to look for admin-override information. Only token is currently supported. String token REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_TYPE The type of information used to determine if a user is an admin. Values depend on the value of the FROM variable, for example, role or claim when FROM is token. String role REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_ROLE The name of the role that indicates a user is an admin. String sr-admin REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_CLAIM The name of a JWT token claim to use for determining admin-override. String org-admin REGISTRY_AUTH_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_CLAIM-VALUE The value that the JWT token claim indicated by the CLAIM variable must be for the user to be granted admin-override. String true For example, you can use this admin-override feature to assign the sr-admin role to a single user in Keycloak, which grants that user the admin role. That user can then use the /admin/roleMappings REST API (or associated UI) to grant roles to additional users (including additional admins). You can set the following option to true to enable owner-only authorization for updates to schema and API artifacts in Apicurio Registry: Table 12. Configuration for owner-only authorization Environment variable Java system property Type Default value OWNER_ONLY_AUTHZ_ENABLED registry.auth.owner-only-authorization Boolean false Enabling owner-only authorization results in a configuration where users with write access can only modify content that they themselves created. Users will not be able to update or delete artifacts created by other users. In addition to the two main types of authorization (role-based and owner-based authorization), Apicurio Registry supports an anonymous read-only access option. To enable anonymous users, such as REST API calls with no authentication credentials provided, to be allowed to make read-only calls to the REST API, set the following option to true: Table 13. Configuration for anonymous read-only access Environment variable Java system property Type Default value REGISTRY_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_READ_ACCESS_ENABLED registry.auth.anonymous-read-access.enabled Boolean false Additional resources For an example of how to set environment variables in your Apicurio Registry deployment on OpenShift, see Configuring Apicurio Registry health checks on OpenShift For details on configuring custom authentication for Apicurio Registry, the see Quarkus Open ID Connect documentation You can configure the Apicurio Registry web console specifically for your deployment environment or to customize its behavior. This section provides details on how to configure optional environment variables for the Apicurio Registry web console. Prerequisites You must have already installed Apicurio Registry. When a user navigates their browser to the Apicurio Registry web console, some initial configuration settings are loaded. Two important configuration properties are: URL for backend Apicurio Registry REST API URL for frontend Apicurio Registry web console Typically, Apicurio Registry automatically detects and generates these settings, but there are some deployment environments where this automatic detection can fail. If this happens, you can configure environment variables to explicitly set these URLs for your environment. Procedure Configure the following environment variables to override the default URLs: REGISTRY_UI_CONFIG_APIURL: Set the URL for the backend Apicurio Registry REST API. For example, https://registry.my-domain.com/apis/registry REGISTRY_UI_CONFIG_UIURL: Set the URL for the frontend Apicurio Registry web console. For example, https://registry.my-domain.com/ui You can configure the Apicurio Registry web console in read-only mode as an optional feature. This mode disables all features in the Apicurio Registry web console that allow users to make changes to registered artifacts. For example, this includes the following: Creating an artifact Uploading a new version of an artifact Updating an artifact’s metadata Deleting an artifact Procedure Configure the following environment variable to set the Apicurio Registry web console in read-only mode: REGISTRY_UI_FEATURES_READONLY: Set to true to enable read-only mode. Defaults to false. You can set Apicurio Registry logging configuration at runtime. Apicurio Registry provides a REST endpoint to set the log level for specific loggers for finer grained logging. This section explains how to view and set Apicurio Registry log levels at runtime using the Apicurio Registry /admin REST API. Prerequisites Get the URL to access your Apicurio Registry instance, or get your Apicurio Registry route if you have Apicurio Registry deployed on OpenShift. This simple example uses a URL of localhost:8080. Procedure Use this curl command to obtain the current log level for the logger io.apicurio.registry.storage: $ curl -i localhost:8080/apis/registry/v2/admin/loggers/io.apicurio.registry.storage HTTP/1.1 200 OK [...] Content-Type: application/json {\"name\":\"io.apicurio.registry.storage\",\"level\":\"INFO\"} Use this curl command to change the log level for the logger io.apicurio.registry.storage to DEBUG: $ curl -X PUT -i -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '{\"level\":\"DEBUG\"}' localhost:8080/apis/registry/v2/admin/loggers/io.apicurio.registry.storage HTTP/1.1 200 OK [...] Content-Type: application/json {\"name\":\"io.apicurio.registry.storage\",\"level\":\"DEBUG\"} Use this curl command to revert the log level for the logger io.apicurio.registry.storage to its default value: $ curl -X DELETE -i localhost:8080/apis/registry/v2/admin/loggers/io.apicurio.registry.storage HTTP/1.1 200 OK [...] Content-Type: application/json {\"name\":\"io.apicurio.registry.storage\",\"level\":\"INFO\"} You can configure Apicurio Registry to send events when changes are made to the registry. For example, Apicurio Registry can trigger events when schema and API artifacts are created, updated, deleted, and so on. You can configure Apicurio Registry to send events to your applications and to third-party integrations in this way. There are different protocols available for transporting the events. The currently implemented protocols are HTTP and Apache Kafka. However, regardless of the protocol, the events are sent using the CNCF CloudEvents specification. All of the event types are defined in io.apicurio.registry.events.dto.RegistryEventType. For example, the event types include: io.apicurio.registry.artifact-created io.apicurio.registry.artifact-updated io.apicurio.registry.artifact-rule-created io.apicurio.registry.global-rule-created You can configure cloud events in Apicurio Registry using Java system properties or equivalent environment variables. Prerequisites You must have an application that you want to send Apicurio Registry cloud events to. For example, this can be a custom application or a third-party application. The example in this section shows a custom application running at http://my-app-host:8888/events. Procedure When using the HTTP protocol, set your Apicurio Registry configuration to send events to a your application as follows: registry.events.sink.my-custom-consumer=http://my-app-host:8888/events If required, you can configure multiple event consumers as follows: registry.events.sink.my-custom-consumer=http://my-app-host:8888/events registry.events.sink.other-consumer=http://my-consumer.com/events The example in this section shows a Kafka topic named my-registry-events running on my-kafka-host:9092. Procedure When using the Kafka protocol, set your Kafka topic as follows: registry.events.kafka.topic=my-registry-events You can set the configuration for the Kafka producer using the KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS environment variable: KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=my-kafka-host:9092 Alternatively, you can set the properties for the kafka producer using the registry.events.kafka.config prefix, for example: registry.events.kafka.config.bootstrap.servers=my-kafka-host:9092 If required, you can also set the Kafka topic partition to use to produce events: registry.events.kafka.topic-partition=1 Additional resources For more details, see the CNCF CloudEvents specification You can configure optional environment variables for liveness and readiness probes to monitor the health of the Apicurio Registry server on OpenShift: Liveness probes test if the application can make progress. If the application cannot make progress, OpenShift automatically restarts the failing Pod. Readiness probes test if the application is ready to process requests. If the application is not ready, it can become overwhelmed by requests, and OpenShift stops sending requests for the time that the probe fails. If other Pods are OK, they continue to receive requests. The default values of the liveness and readiness environment variables are designed for most cases and should only be changed if required by your environment. Any changes to the defaults depend on your hardware, network, and amount of data stored. These values should be kept as low as possible to avoid unnecessary overhead. Prerequisites You must have an OpenShift cluster with cluster administrator access. You must have already installed Apicurio Registry on OpenShift. You must have already installed and configured your chosen Apicurio Registry storage in Strimzi or PostgreSQL. Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Click Installed Operators > Apicurio Registry. On the ApicurioRegistry tab, click the Operator custom resource for your deployment, for example, example-apicurioregistry. In the main overview page, find the Deployment Name section and the corresponding DeploymentConfig name for your Apicurio Registry deployment, for example, example-apicurioregistry. In the left navigation menu, click Workloads > Deployment Configs, and select your DeploymentConfig name. Click the Environment tab, and enter your environment variables in the Single values env section, for example: NAME: LIVENESS_STATUS_RESET VALUE: 350 Click Save at the bottom. Alternatively, you can perform these steps using the OpenShift oc command. For more details, see the OpenShift CLI documentation. Additional resources Environment variables for Apicurio Registry health checks OpenShift documentation on monitoring application health This section describes the available environment variables for Apicurio Registry health checks on OpenShift. These include liveness and readiness probes to monitor the health of the Apicurio Registry server on OpenShift. For an example procedure, see [configuring-liveness-readiness-probes]. The following environment variables are provided for reference only. The default values are designed for most cases and should only be changed if required by your environment. Any changes to the defaults depend on your hardware, network, and amount of data stored. These values should be kept as low as possible to avoid unnecessary overhead. Table 14. Environment variables for Apicurio Registry liveness probes Name Description Type Default LIVENESS_ERROR_THRESHOLD Number of liveness issues or errors that can occur before the liveness probe fails. Integer 1 LIVENESS_COUNTER_RESET Period in which the threshold number of errors must occur. For example, if this value is 60 and the threshold is 1, the check fails after two errors occur in 1 minute Seconds 60 LIVENESS_STATUS_RESET Number of seconds that must elapse without any more errors for the liveness probe to reset to OK status. Seconds 300 LIVENESS_ERRORS_IGNORED Comma-separated list of ignored liveness exceptions. String io.grpc.StatusRuntimeException,org.apache.kafka.streams.errors.InvalidStateStoreException Because OpenShift automatically restarts a Pod that fails a liveness check, the liveness settings, unlike readiness settings, do not directly affect behavior of Apicurio Registry on OpenShift. Table 15. Environment variables for Apicurio Registry readiness probes Name Description Type Default READINESS_ERROR_THRESHOLD Number of readiness issues or errors that can occur before the readiness probe fails. Integer 1 READINESS_COUNTER_RESET Period in which the threshold number of errors must occur. For example, if this value is 60 and the threshold is 1, the check fails after two errors occur in 1 minute. Seconds 60 READINESS_STATUS_RESET Number of seconds that must elapse without any more errors for the liveness probe to reset to OK status. In this case, this means how long the Pod stays not ready, until it returns to normal operation.

All configured global rules or artifact rules must pass before a new artifact version can be uploaded to the registry. Configured artifact rules override any configured global rules. The goal of these rules is to prevent invalid content from being added to the registry. For example, content can be invalid for the following reasons: Invalid syntax for a given artifact type (for example, AVRO or PROTOBUF) Valid syntax, but semantics violate a specification Incompatibility, when new content includes breaking changes relative to the current artifact version You can enable optional content rules using the Apicurio Registry web console, REST API commands, or a Java client application. Rules are applied only when content is added to the registry. This includes the following REST operations: Adding an artifact Updating an artifact Adding an artifact version If a rule is violated, Apicurio Registry returns an HTTP error. The response body includes the violated rule and a message showing what went wrong. You can configure Apicurio Registry content rules at a global level and at an artifact level. The order of precedence is as follows: If you enable an artifact rule and the equivalent global rule, the artifact rule overrides the global rule. If you disable an artifact rule, and enable the equivalent global rule, the global rule applies. If you disable a rule at the artifact level and at the global level, you disable the rule for all artifacts. If you set a rule value to NONE at the artifact level, you override the enabled global rule. In this case, the artifact rule value NONE takes precedence for this artifact, but the enabled global rule continues to apply to any other artifacts that have the rule disabled at the artifact level. Each rule has a name and configuration information. The registry maintains the list of rules for each artifact and the list of global rules. Each rule in the list consists of a name and configuration for the rule implementation. A rule is provided with the content of the current version of the artifact (if one exists) and the new version of the artifact being added. The rule implementation returns true or false depending on whether the artifact passes the rule. If not, the registry reports the reason why in an HTTP error response. Some rules might not use the previous version of the content. For example, compatibility rules use previous versions, but syntax or semantic validity rules do not. Additional resources For more details, see Apicurio Registry artifact reference. You can configure rules individually for each artifact, as well as globally. Apicurio Registry applies the rules configured for the specific artifact. If no rules are configured at that level, Apicurio Registry applies the globally configured rules. If no global rules are configured, no rules are applied. You can configure artifact rules using the Apicurio Registry web console or REST API. For details, see the following: Managing Apicurio Registry content using the web console Apicurio Registry REST API documentation You can configure global rules in several ways: Use the /rules operations in the REST API Use the Apicurio Registry web console Set default global rules using Apicurio Registry application properties Configure default global rules You can configure Apicurio Registry at the application level to enable or disable global rules. You can configure default global rules at installation time without post-install configuration using the following application property format: registry.rules.global. The following rule names are currently supported: compatibility validity The value of the application property must be a valid configuration option that is specific to the rule being configured. The following table shows the valid values for each rule: Table 1.

You can use Apicurio Registry to decouple the structure of your data from your client applications, and to share and manage your data types and API descriptions at runtime using a REST interface. For example, client applications can dynamically push or pull the latest schema updates to or from Apicurio Registry at runtime without needing to redeploy. Developer teams can query the registry for existing schemas required for services already deployed in production, and can register new schemas required for new services in development. You can enable client applications to use schemas and API designs stored in Apicurio Registry by specifying the registry URL in your client application code. For example, the registry can store schemas used to serialize and deserialize messages, which are then referenced from your client applications to ensure that the messages that they send and receive are compatible with those schemas. Using Apicurio Registry to decouple your data structure from your applications reduces costs by decreasing overall message size, and creates efficiencies by increasing consistent reuse of schemas and API designs across your organization. Apicurio Registry provides a web console to make it easy for developers and administrators to manage registry content. In addition, you can configure optional rules to govern the evolution of your registry content. For example, these include rules to ensure that uploaded content is syntactically and semantically valid, or is backwards and forwards compatible with other versions. Any configured rules must pass before new versions can be uploaded to the registry, which ensures that time is not wasted on invalid or incompatible schemas or API designs. Multiple payload formats for standard event schema and API specifications such as Apache Avro, JSON Schema, Protobuf, AsyncAPI, OpenAPI, and more Pluggable registry storage options in Apache Kafka or PostgreSQL database Rules for content validation and version compatibility to govern how registry content evolves over time Registry content management using web console, REST API, command line, Maven plug-in, or Java client Full Apache Kafka schema registry support, including integration with Kafka Connect for external systems Kafka client serializers/deserializers (SerDes) to validate message types at runtime Compatibility with existing Confluent or IBM schema registry client applications Cloud-native Quarkus Java runtime for low memory footprint and fast deployment times Operator-based installation of Apicurio Registry on OpenShift OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication using Keycloak The items stored in Apicurio Registry, such as event schemas and API designs, are known as registry artifacts. The following shows an example of an Apache Avro schema artifact in JSON format for a simple share price application: { \"type\": \"record\", \"name\": \"price\", \"namespace\": \"com.example\", \"fields\": [ { \"name\": \"symbol\", \"type\": \"string\" }, { \"name\": \"price\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } When a schema or API design is added as an artifact in the registry, client applications can then use that schema or API design to validate that the client messages conform to the correct data structure at runtime. Apicurio Registry supports a wide range of message payload formats for standard event schemas and API specifications. For example, supported formats include Apache Avro, Google Protobuf, GraphQL, AsyncAPI, OpenAPI, and others. An artifact group is an optional named collection of schema or API artifacts. Each group contains a logically related set of schemas or API designs, typically managed by a single entity, belonging to a particular application or organization. You can create optional artifact groups when adding your schemas and API designs to organize them in Apicurio Registry. For example, you could create groups to match your development and production application environments, or your sales and engineering organizations. Schema and API groups can contain multiple artifact types. For example, you could have Protobuf, Avro, JSON Schema, OpenAPI, and AsyncAPI schema and API artifacts all in the same group. You can create schema and API artifacts and optional groups using the Apicurio Registry web console, core REST API, command line, Maven plug-in, or Java client application. The following simple example shows using the registry core REST API: $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-type: application/json; artifactType=AVRO\" \\ -H \"X-Registry-ArtifactId: share-price\" \\ --data '{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"price\",\"namespace\":\"com.example\", \\ \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]}' \\ https://my-registry.example.com/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts This example creates an artifact group named my-group and adds an Avro schema with an artifact ID of share-price. Specifying a group is optional when using the Apicurio Registry web console, where a default group is automatically created. When using the REST API or Maven plug-in, you can specify the default group in the API path if you do not want to create a unique group. Additional resources For more details on schemas and groups, see the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Schema Registry API For details on the Apicurio Registry core REST API, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation You can use the Apicurio Registry web console to browse and search the schema and API artifacts and optional groups stored in the registry, and to add new schema and API artifacts, groups, and versions. You can search for artifacts by label, name, group, and description. You can view an artifact’s content or its available versions, or download an artifact file locally. You can also configure optional rules for registry content, both globally and for each schema and API artifact. These optional rules for content validation and compatibility are applied when new schema and API artifacts or versions are uploaded to the registry. For more details, see Apicurio Registry artifact reference. Figure 1. Apicurio Registry web console The Apicurio Registry web console is available from http://MY_REGISTRY_URL/ui. Additional resources Managing Apicurio Registry content using the web console Client applications can use the Using the Apicurio Registry core v2 REST API to manage the schema and API artifacts in Apicurio Registry. This API provides create, read, update, and delete operations for: Artifacts Manage schema and API artifacts stored in the registry. You can also manage the lifecycle state of an artifact: enabled, disabled, or deprecated. Artifact versions Manage versions that are created when a schema or API artifact is updated. You can also manage the lifecycle state of an artifact version: enabled, disabled, or deprecated. Artifact metadata Manage details about a schema or API artifact, such as when it was created or modified, and its current state. You can edit the artifact name, description, or labels. The artifact group and when the artifact was created or modified are read-only. Artifact rules Configure rules to govern the content evolution of a specific schema or API artifact to prevent invalid or incompatible content from being added to the registry. Artifact rules override any global rules configured. Global rules Configure rules to govern the content evolution of all schema and API artifacts to prevent invalid or incompatible content from being added to the registry. Global rules are applied only if an artifact does not have its own specific artifact rules configured. Search Browse or search for schema and API artifacts and versions, for example, by name, group, description, or label. Admin Export or import registry content in a .zip file, and manage logging levels for the registry server instance at runtime. Apicurio Registry provides compatibility with the following schema registries by including implementations of their respective REST APIs: Apicurio Registry core v1 Confluent Schema Registry v6 IBM Event Streams schema registry v1 CNCF CloudEvents Schema Registry v0 Applications using Confluent client libraries can use Apicurio Registry as a drop-in replacement. Additional resources For detailed reference information, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation API documentation for the core Apicurio Registry REST API and for all compatible APIs is available from the main endpoint of your Apicurio Registry instance, for example, on http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis Apicurio Registry provides the following options for the underlying storage of registry data: In-memory PostgreSQL 12 database Apache Kafka 2.6 The in-memory storage option is suitable for a development environment only. All data is lost when restarting Apicurio Registry with this storage. The PostgreSQL or Kafka storage option is recommended for a production environment. Additional resources Installing Apicurio Registry using Docker Installing Apicurio Registry on OpenShift Installing Apicurio Registry storage on OpenShift Kafka producer applications can use serializers to encode messages that conform to a specific event schema. Kafka consumer applications can then use deserializers to validate that messages have been serialized using the correct schema, based on a specific schema ID. Figure 2. Apicurio Registry and Kafka client SerDes architecture Apicurio Registry provides Kafka client serializers/deserializers (SerDes) to validate the following message types at runtime: Apache Avro Google protocol buffers JSON Schema The Apicurio Registry Maven repository and source code distributions include the Kafka SerDes implementations for these message types, which Kafka client application developers can use to integrate with the registry. These implementations include custom Java classes for each supported message type, for example, io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro, which client applications can use to pull schemas from the registry at runtime for validation. Additional resources Validating schemas using Kafka client serializers/deserializers in Java You can use Apicurio Registry with Apache Kafka Connect to stream data between Kafka and external systems. Using Kafka Connect, you can define connectors for different systems to move large volumes of data into and out of Kafka-based systems. Figure 3. Apicurio Registry and Kafka Connect architecture Apicurio Registry provides the following features for Kafka Connect: Storage for Kafka Connect schemas Kafka Connect converters for Apache Avro and JSON Schema Registry REST API to manage schemas You can use the Avro and JSON Schema converters to map Kafka Connect schemas into Avro or JSON schemas. Those schemas can then serialize message keys and values into the compact Avro binary format or human-readable JSON format. The converted JSON is also less verbose because the messages do not contain the schema information, only the schema ID. Apicurio Registry can manage and track the Avro and JSON schemas used in the Kafka topics. Because the schemas are stored in Apicurio Registry and decoupled from the message content, each message must only include a tiny schema identifier. For an I/O bound system like Kafka, this means more total throughput for producers and consumers. The Avro and JSON Schema serializers and deserializers (SerDes) provided by Apicurio Registry are also used by Kafka producers and consumers in this use case. Kafka consumer applications that you write to consume change events can use the Avro or JSON Serdes to deserialize these change events. You can install these SerDes into any Kafka-based system and use them along with Kafka Connect, or with Kafka Connect-based systems such as Debezium and Camel Kafka Connector. Additional resources Apache Kafka Connect documentation Demonstration of using Kafka Connect with Debezium and Apicurio Registry Apicurio Registry provides open source example applications that demonstrate how to use Apicurio Registry in different use case scenarios. For example, these include storing schemas used by Kafka serializer and deserializer (SerDes) classes. These Java classes fetch the schema from the registry for use when producing or consuming operations to serialize, deserialize, or validate the Kafka message payload. These example applications include the following: Apache Avro SerDes Google Protobuf SerDes JSON Schema SerDes Confluent SerDes Custom ID strategy REST client Cloud Events Quarkus and Kafka Apache Camel with Quarkus and Kafka Additional resources For more details, see https://github.com/Apicurio/apicurio-registry-examples Apicurio Registry provides the following distribution options.

The Registry REST API provides create, read, update, and delete operations for artifacts, versions, metadata, and rules stored in the registry. For detailed information, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation. This chapter describes the Apicurio Registry core REST API and shows how to use it to manage schema and API artifacts stored in the registry: Managing schema and API artifacts using Apicurio Registry REST API commands Managing schema and API artifact versions using Apicurio Registry REST API commands Exporting and importing registry content using Apicurio Registry REST API commands Prerequisites Introduction to Apicurio Registry Additional resources Apicurio Registry REST API documentation This section shows a simple curl-based example of using the Apicurio Registry core REST API to add and retrieve an Apache Avro schema artifact in Apicurio Registry. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment Procedure Add an artifact to the registry using the /groups/{group}/artifacts operation. The following example curl command adds a simple artifact for a share price application: $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-type: application/json; artifactType=AVRO\" \\ -H \"X-Registry-ArtifactId: share-price\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --data '{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"price\",\"namespace\":\"com.example\", \\ \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]}' \\ http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts This example adds an Avro schema artifact with an artifact ID of share-price. If you do not specify a unique artifact ID, Apicurio Registry generates one automatically as a UUID. MY-REGISTRY-URL is the host name on which Apicurio Registry is deployed. For example: http://localhost:8080. This example specifies a group ID of my-group in the API path. If you do not specify a unique group ID, you must specify ../groups/default in the API path. Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body to confirm that the artifact was added. For example: {\"createdBy\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2021-04-16T09:07:51+0000\",\"modifiedBy\":\"\", \"modifiedOn\":\"2021-04-16T09:07:51+0000\",\"id\":\"share-price\",\"version\":\"1\", \"type\":\"AVRO\",\"globalId\":2,\"state\":\"ENABLED\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"contentId\":2} No version was specified when adding the artifact, so the default version 1 is created automatically. This was the second artifact added to the registry, so the global ID and content ID have a value of 2. Retrieve the artifact content from the registry using its artifact ID in the API path. In this example, the specified ID is share-price: $ curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts/share-price \\ {\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"price\",\"namespace\":\"com.example\", \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]} Additional resources For more REST API sample requests, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation If you do not specify an artifact version when adding schema and API artifacts to Apicurio Registry using the v2 core REST API, Apicurio Registry generates one automatically. The default version when creating a new artifact is 1. Apicurio Registry also supports custom versioning where you can specify a version using the X-Registry-Version HTTP request header as a string. Specifying a custom version value overrides the default version normally assigned when creating or updating an artifact. You can then use this version value when executing REST API operations that require a version. This section shows a simple curl-based example of using the registry v2 core REST API to add and retrieve a custom Apache Avro schema version in the registry. You can specify custom versions when using the REST API to add or update artifacts or to add artifact versions. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment Procedure Add an artifact version in the registry using the /groups/{group}/artifacts operation. The following example curl command adds a simple artifact for a share price application: $ curl -X POST -H \"Content-type: application/json; artifactType=AVRO\" \\ -H \"X-Registry-ArtifactId: my-share-price\" -H \"X-Registry-Version: 1.1.1\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --data '{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\" p\",\"namespace\":\"com.example\", \\ \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]}' \\ http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts This example adds an Avro schema artifact with an artifact ID of my-share-price and version of 1.1.1. If you do not specify a version, Apicurio Registry automatically generates a default version of 1. MY-REGISTRY-URL is the host name on which Apicurio Registry is deployed. For example: http://localhost:8080. This example specifies a group ID of my-group in the API path. If you do not specify a unique group ID, you must specify ../groups/default in the API path. Verify that the response includes the expected JSON body to confirm that the custom artifact version was added. For example: {\"createdBy\":\"\",\"createdOn\":\"2021-04-16T10:51:43+0000\",\"modifiedBy\":\"\", \"modifiedOn\":\"2021-04-16T10:51:43+0000\",\"id\":\"my-share-price\",\"version\":\"1.1.1\", \"type\":\"AVRO\",\"globalId\":3,\"state\":\"ENABLED\",\"groupId\":\"my-group\",\"contentId\":3} A custom version of 1.1.1 was specified when adding the artifact. This was the third artifact added to the registry, so the global ID and content ID have a value of 3. Retrieve the artifact content from the registry using its artifact ID and version in the API path. In this example, the specified ID is my-share-price and the version is 1.1.1: $ curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts/my-share-price/versions/1.1.1 {\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"price\",\"namespace\":\"com.example\", \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]} Additional resources For more REST API sample requests, see the Apicurio Registry REST API documentation As an administrator, you can use the Apicurio Registry REST API to export data from one Apicurio Registry instance and import it into another Apicurio Registry instance, so you can migrate data between different instances. This section shows a simple curl-based example of using the core registry v2 REST API to export and import existing registry data in .zip format from one Apicurio Registry instance to another. All of the artifact data contained in the Apicurio Registry instance is exported in the .zip file. You can only import Apicurio Registry data that has been exported from another Apicurio Registry instance. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry is installed and running in your environment Apicurio Registry instances have been created: The source instance that you want to export data from contains at least one schema or API artifact The target instance that you want to import data into is empty to perserve unique IDs Procedure Export the registry data from your existing source Apicurio Registry instance: $ curl http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/admin/export \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --output my-registry-data.zip MY-REGISTRY-URL is the host name on which the source Apicurio Registry is deployed. For example: http://my-source-registry:8080. Import the registry data into your target Apicurio Registry instance: $ curl -X POST \"http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2/admin/import\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/zip\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\ --data-binary @my-registry-data.zip MY-REGISTRY-URL is the host name on which the target Apicurio Registry is deployed.

This section provides details on how to configure optional environment variables for the Apicurio Registry web console. Prerequisites You must have already installed Apicurio Registry. When a user navigates their browser to the Apicurio Registry web console, some initial configuration settings are loaded. Two important configuration properties are: URL for backend Apicurio Registry REST API URL for frontend Apicurio Registry web console Typically, Apicurio Registry automatically detects and generates these settings, but there are some deployment environments where this automatic detection can fail. If this happens, you can configure environment variables to explicitly set these URLs for your environment. Procedure Configure the following environment variables to override the default URLs: REGISTRY_UI_CONFIG_APIURL: Set the URL for the backend Apicurio Registry REST API. For example, https://registry.my-domain.com/apis/registry REGISTRY_UI_CONFIG_UIURL: Set the URL for the frontend Apicurio Registry web console. For example, https://registry.my-domain.com/ui You can configure the Apicurio Registry web console in read-only mode as an optional feature. This mode disables all features in the Apicurio Registry web console that allow users to make changes to registered artifacts. For example, this includes the following: Creating an artifact Uploading a new version of an artifact Updating an artifact’s metadata Deleting an artifact Procedure Configure the following environment variable to set the Apicurio Registry web console in read-only mode: REGISTRY_UI_FEATURES_READONLY: Set to true to enable read-only mode. Defaults to false. You can use the Apicurio Registry web console to upload event schema and API design artifacts to the registry. This section shows simple examples of uploading Apicurio Registry artifacts and adding new artifact versions. Prerequisites Apicurio Registry must be installed and running in your environment Procedure Connect to the Apicurio Registry web console on: http://MY_REGISTRY_URL/ui Click Upload artifact, and specify the following: Group & ID: Use the default empty settings to automatically generate an ID and default group, or enter an optional artifact group or ID. Type: Use the default Auto-Detect setting to automatically detect the artifact type, or select the artifact type from the drop-down, for example, Avro Schema or OpenAPI. Apicurio Registry cannot automatically detect the Kafka Connect Schema artifact type. You must manually select this artifact type. Artifact: Drag and drop or click Browse to upload a file, for example, my-schema.json or my-openapi.json. Click Upload and view the Artifact Details. This example shows an Avro schema artifact: Figure 1. Artifact Details in Apicurio Registry web console Info: Displays the artifact name and optional group, description, lifecycle status, when created, and last modified.

Migration from Apicurio Registry 1.3.x to 2.x Migrating Apicurio Registry data Migrating Apicurio Registry client applications Apicurio Registry 2.x includes new features with breaking changes from the previous Apicurio Registry 1.3.x release. This section describes the major changes between Apicurio Registry 1.3.x and version 2.x. Because of the breaking changes in 2.x, there is no automatic upgrade and a migration process is required. This involves moving the data in your existing registry to a new registry. You must also review your existing registry client applications and update their configuration to meet the new requirements. When migrating to version 2.x, you must take the following major changes into account: The existing registry data storage options in Apicurio Registry 1.3.x (streams,jpa, and infinispan) have been replaced with new storage options in version 2.x (sql and kafkasql). These new storage options provide more robust, performant, and maintainable Apicurio Registry deployments. The in-memory storage option (mem) is also still available, but is not suitable for production workloads. For details on how to deploy Apicurio Registry 2.x with your chosen storage option, see Installing Apicurio Registry storage on OpenShift. Apicurio Registry 2.x includes a new REST API with support for artifact groups and improved long term maintainability. Apicurio Registry still supports the original registry v1 REST API and compatibility APIs, for example, Confluent and IBM schema registry APIs. Apicurio Registry now also implements the Schema Registry specification provided in the CNCF Cloud Events specification. The Apicurio Registry Java client classes are available in version 2.x in a different Maven module named apicurio-registry-client. The Kakfa client serializer and deserializer (SerDe) classes are available in version 2.x in three different Maven modules, one for each supported data format: Apache Avro, Protobuf, and JSON Schema. You can now use only the module you want without pulling in transitive dependencies that you are not concerned with. Additional resources For more details on the v2 REST API, see the Registry REST API documentation Migrating data to Apicurio Registry 2.x requires exporting all data from your existing 1.3.x deployment and importing it into the new 2.x deployment. If you are using Apicurio Registry as a schema registry for Kafka applications, data migration is critical because each Kafka message carries the global identifier for the schema stored in Apicurio Registry. This identifier must be preserved during registry data migration. Apicurio Registry 2.x provides an API to bulk import/export all data from your registry deployment, which guarantees that all identifiers are kept when importing data from your existing registry. The export API downloads a custom .zip file containing all the information for your artifacts. The import API accepts this .zip and loads all artifacts into the registry in a single batch. Apicurio Registry 1.3.x does not provide an import/export API. However, version 2.x provides an export tool compatible with Apicurio Registry 1.3.x to export a .zip, which you can import into your 2.x registry. This tool uses common existing APIs to export all content in the registry. However, it is less performant than the 2.x export API, and should only be used when exporting from a 1.3.x registry. Prerequisites Running Apicurio Registry instances of the 1.3.x server you are exporting from and the 2.x server you are importing into. Download the Apicurio Registry exportV1 tool from GitHub. This is a Java application that you can run on the command line. Procedure Export all the data from Apicurio Registry 1.3.x using the exportV1 tool. This generates a registry-export.zip file in your current directory: java -jar apicurio-registry-utils-exportV1-2.2.1.Final.jar http://old-registry.my-company.com/api Import the .zip file into Apicurio Registry 2.x using the import API: curl -X POST \"http://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v2/admin/import\" \\ -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/zip\" \\ --data-binary @registry-export.zip Check that all the artifacts have been imported into the new 2.x registry by running these commands and comparing the count field: curl \"http://old-registry.my-company.com/api/search/artifacts\" curl \"http://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v2/search/artifacts\" Additional resources For more details on the import/export REST API, see Managing Apicurio Registry content using the REST API For more details on the export tool for migrating from version 1.x to 2.x, see the Apicurio Registry export utility for 1.x versions You must review your existing Apicurio Registry client applications to ensure that the Maven dependencies and Java client configuration meet the new requirements for version 2.x. For example, this includes new Maven dependencies for the Apicurio Registry Java REST client libraries or Kafka client serializer/deserializer (Serdes) libraries. You must also update your Java application configuration with the new registry v2 API path. Prerequisites Existing Apicurio Registry 1.3.x Java client application or Kafka client producer and consumer Java applications with SerDes Procedure If you are using the Apicurio Registry Java REST client, you must change the Maven dependencies for the Apicurio Registry Java client libraries, which have been repackaged in version 2.x: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-client 2.2.1.Final In your Java client application, you must change your registry URL configuration, from pointing to the existing v1 API path to the new v2 path. For example: public class ClientExample { private static final RegistryRestClient client; public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { // Create a registry client String registryUrl = \"https://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v2\"; RegistryClient client = RegistryClientFactory.create(registryUrl); } } You can find more details on the Java client in Managing Apicurio Registry content using a Java client. If you are using the Apicurio Registry SerDes libraries, you must change the Maven dependencies, which have been repackaged in version 2.x. In Apicurio Registry 1.3.x, the SerDes libraries were all provided with only one Maven dependency: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-utils-serde 1.3.2.Final In Apicurio Registry 2.x, the SerDes libraries have been split into three Maven dependencies, one for each supported data format: avro, protobuf, and json schema, depending on your use cases: io.apicurio apicurio-registry-serdes-avro-serde 2.2.1.Final io.apicurio apicurio-registry-serdes-protobuf-serde 2.2.1.Final io.apicurio apicurio-registry-serdes-jsonschema-serde 2.2.1.Final In your Kafka producer and consumer Java applications, you must change your registry URL configuration from pointing to the existing v1 API path to the new v2 path. For example: Existing registry v1 API path: props.putIfAbsent(AbstractKafkaSerDe.REGISTRY_URL_CONFIG_PARAM, \"http://old-registry.my-company.com/api\"); New registry v2 API path: props.putIfAbsent(SerdeConfig.REGISTRY_URL, \"http://new-registry.my-company.com/apis/registry/v2\"); The refactored SerDes libraries also include other important changes to configuration properties.

Kafka producer applications use serializers to encode messages that conform to a specific event schema. Kafka consumer applications use deserializers to validate that messages have been serialized using the correct schema, based on a specific schema ID. This ensures consistent schema use and helps to prevent data errors at runtime. This chapter explains how to use Kafka client SerDes in your producer and consumer client applications: Kafka client applications and Apicurio Registry Strategies to look up a schema in Apicurio Registry Registering a schema in Apicurio Registry Using a schema from a Kafka consumer client Using a schema from a Kafka producer client Using a schema from a Kafka Streams application Prerequisites You have read Introduction to Apicurio Registry You have installed Apicurio Registry You have created Kafka producer and consumer client applications Apicurio Registry decouples schema management from client application configuration. You can enable a Java client application to use a schema from Apicurio Registry by specifying its URL in your client code. You can store the schemas in the registry to serialize and deserialize messages, which are referenced from your client applications to ensure that the messages that they send and receive are compatible with those schemas. Kafka client applications can push or pull their schemas from Apicurio Registry at runtime. Schemas can evolve, so you can define rules in Apicurio Registry, for example, to ensure that schema changes are valid and do not break previous versions used by applications. Apicurio Registry checks for compatibility by comparing a modified schema with previous schema versions. Apicurio Registry provides schema registry support for schema technologies such as: Avro Protobuf JSON Schema These schema technologies can be used by client applications through the Kafka client serializer/deserializer (SerDes) services provided by Apicurio Registry. The maturity and usage of the SerDes classes provided by Apicurio Registry might vary. The sections that follow provide more details about each schema type. A producer client application uses a serializer to put the messages that it sends to a specific broker topic into the correct data format. To enable a producer to use Apicurio Registry for serialization: Define and register your schema with Apicurio Registry (if it does not already exist). Configure your producer client code with the following: URL of Apicurio Registry Apicurio Registry serializer to use with messages Strategy to map the Kafka message to a schema artifact in Apicurio Registry Strategy to look up or register the schema used for serialization in Apicurio Registry After registering your schema, when you start Kafka and Apicurio Registry, you can access the schema to format messages sent to the Kafka broker topic by the producer. Alternatively, depending on configuration, the producer can automatically register the schema on first use. If a schema already exists, you can create a new version using the registry REST API based on compatibility rules defined in Apicurio Registry. Versions are used for compatibility checking as a schema evolves. A group ID, artifact ID, and version represents a unique tuple that identifies a schema. A consumer client application uses a deserializer to get the messages that it consumes from a specific broker topic into the correct data format. To enable a consumer to use Apicurio Registry for deserialization: Define and register your schema with Apicurio Registry (if it does not already exist) Configure the consumer client code with the following: URL of Apicurio Registry Apicurio Registry deserializer to use with the messages Input data stream for deserialization Retrieve schemas using a global ID By default, the schema is retrieved from Apicurio Registry by the deserializer using a global ID, which is specified in the message being consumed. The schema global ID can be located in the message headers or in the message payload, depending on the configuration of the producer application. When locating the global ID in the message payload, the format of the data begins with a magic byte, used as a signal to consumers, followed by the global ID, and the message data as normal. For example: # ... [MAGIC_BYTE] [GLOBAL_ID] [MESSAGE DATA] Then when you start Kafka and Apicurio Registry, you can access the schema to format messages received from the Kafka broker topic. Retrieve schemas using a content ID Alternatively, you can configure to retrieve schemas from Apicurio Registry based on the content ID, which is the unique ID of the artifact content. While the global ID is the unique ID of an artifact version. The content ID does not uniquely identify a version, but uniquely identifies the version content only. If multiple versions share the exact same content, they have a different global ID but the same content ID. Confluent Schema Registry uses content ID by default. The Kafka client serializer uses lookup strategies to determine the artifact ID and global ID under which the message schema is registered in Apicurio Registry. For a given topic and message, you can use different implementations of the ArtifactReferenceResolverStrategy Java interface to return a reference to an artifact in the registry. The classes for each strategy are in the io.apicurio.registry.serde.strategy package. Specific strategy classes for Avro SerDes are in the io.apicurio.registry.serde.avro.strategy package. The default strategy is the TopicIdStrategy, which looks for Apicurio Registry artifacts with the same name as the Kafka topic receiving messages. Example public ArtifactReference artifactReference(String topic, boolean isKey, T schema) { return ArtifactReference.builder() .groupId(null) .artifactId(String.format(\"%s-%s\", topic, isKey ? \"key\" : \"value\")) .build(); The topic parameter is the name of the Kafka topic receiving the message. The isKey parameter is true when the message key is serialized, and false when the message value is serialized. The schema parameter is the schema of the message serialized or deserialized. The ArtifactReference returned contains the artifact ID under which the schema is registered. Which lookup strategy you use depends on how and where you store your schema. For example, you might use a strategy that uses a record ID if you have different Kafka topics with the same Avro message type. The artifact resolver strategy provides a way to map the Kafka topic and message information to an artifact in Apicurio Registry. The common convention for the mapping is to combine the Kafka topic name with the key or value, depending on whether the serializer is used for the Kafka message key or value. However, you can use alternative conventions for the mapping by using a strategy provided by Apicurio Registry, or by creating a custom Java class that implements io.apicurio.registry.serde.strategy.ArtifactReferenceResolverStrategy. Apicurio Registry provides the following strategies to return a reference to an artifact based on an implementation of ArtifactReferenceResolverStrategy: RecordIdStrategy Avro-specific strategy that uses the full name of the schema. TopicRecordIdStrategy Avro-specific strategy that uses the topic name and the full name of the schema. TopicIdStrategy Default strategy that uses the topic name and key or value suffix. SimpleTopicIdStrategy Simple strategy that only uses the topic name. The default schema resolver locates and identifies the specific version of the schema registered under the artifact reference provided by the artifact resolver strategy. Every version of every artifact has a single globally unique identifier that can be used to retrieve the content of that artifact. This global ID is included in every Kafka message so that a deserializer can properly fetch the schema from Apicurio Registry. The default schema resolver can look up an existing artifact version, or it can register one if not found, depending on which strategy is used. You can also provide your own strategy by creating a custom Java class that implements io.apicurio.registry.resolver.SchemaResolver. However, it is recommended to use the DefaultSchemaResolver and specify configuration properties instead. When using the DefaultSchemaResolver, you can configure its behavior using application properties. The following table shows some commonly used examples: Table 1. Apicurio Registry lookup configuration options Property Type Description Default apicurio.registry.find-latest boolean Specify whether the serializer tries to find the latest artifact in the registry for the corresponding group ID and artifact ID. false apicurio.registry.use-id String Instructs the serializer to write the specified ID to Kafka and instructs the deserializer to use this ID to find the schema. None apicurio.registry.auto-register boolean Specify whether the serializer tries to create an artifact in the registry. The JSON Schema serializer does not support this. false apicurio.registry.check-period-ms String Specify how long to cache the global ID in milliseconds. If not configured, the global ID is fetched every time. None After you have defined a schema in the appropriate format, such as Apache Avro, you can add the schema to Apicurio Registry. You can add the schema using the following approaches: Apicurio Registry web console curl command using the Apicurio Registry REST API Maven plug-in supplied with Apicurio Registry Schema configuration added to your client code Client applications cannot use Apicurio Registry until you have registered your schemas. When Apicurio Registry is installed, you can connect to the web console from the ui endpoint: http://MY-REGISTRY-URL/ui From the console, you can add, view and configure schemas. You can also create the rules that prevent invalid content being added to the registry. curl -X POST -H \"Content-type: application/json; artifactType=AVRO\" \\ -H \"X-Registry-ArtifactId: share-price\" \\ (1) --data '{ \"type\":\"record\", \"name\":\"price\", \"namespace\":\"com.example\", \"fields\":[{\"name\":\"symbol\",\"type\":\"string\"}, {\"name\":\"price\",\"type\":\"string\"}]}' https://my-cluster-my-registry-my-project.example.com/apis/registry/v2/groups/my-group/artifacts -s (2) 1 Simple Avro schema artifact. 2 OpenShift route name that exposes Apicurio Registry. io.apicurio apicurio-registry-maven-plugin ${apicurio.version} generate-sources register (1) http://REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2 (2) TestGroup (3) FullNameRecord ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/schemas/record.avsc FAIL TestGroup ExampleAPI (4) GRAPHQL ${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/apis/example.graphql RETURN_OR_UPDATE true 1 Specify register as the execution goal to upload the schema artifact to the registry. 2 Specify the Apicurio Registry URL with the ../apis/registry/v2 endpoint. 3 Specify the Apicurio Registry artifact group ID. 4 You can upload multiple artifacts using the specified group ID, artifact ID, and location.

If you are deploying to Kubernetes, you can use command line tools to install Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), and instruct it to deploy the Apicurio Registry or other Operators. Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to a Kubernetes cluster. Procedure Go to OperatorHub.io - Apicurio Registry page. Select the Version you want to install Read the information about the Operator, and click Install. Follow the instructions on the installation page. The recommended way to install Apicurio Registry Operator is to use the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which can automatically manage the Operator deployment and upgrades. Apicurio Registry Operator is released to the OperatorHub, so if your cluster has the OLM and OperatorHub installed, the cluster administrator can use the OpenShift web console to deploy the Apicurio Registry Operator: Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to an OpenShift cluster. Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Create a new OpenShift project: In the left navigation menu, click Home > Project > Create Project. Enter a project name, for example, my-project, and click Create. In the left navigation menu, click Operators > OperatorHub. In the Filter by keyword text box, enter registry to find the Apicurio Registry Operator. Read the information about the Operator, and click Install. This displays the Create Operator Subscription page. Select your subscription settings, for example: Installation Mode > A specific namespace on the cluster > my-project Update Channel > 2.x Approval Strategy > Automatic Click Subscribe. This displays the Operators > Installed Operators page. Wait a few moments until the Status for the Apicurio Registry Operator displays Succeeded and the subscription is Up to Date. Additional resources Adding Operators to an OpenShift cluster The recommended Kafka storage option requires that you provide connection information to a Kafka cluster. You can use any Kafka cluster with Kafka support. However, it is recommended to use the Strimzi Operator to provide and maintain a Kafka cluster for you. If you do not already have Kafka installed, you can install the Strimzi Operator on your OpenShift cluster from the OperatorHub. Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to an OpenShift cluster Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Change to the OpenShift project in which Apicurio Registry is installed. For example, from the Project drop-down, select my-project. In the left navigation menu, click Operators > OperatorHub. In the Filter by keyword text box, enter Strimzi to find the Strimzi Operator. Read the information about the Operator, and click Install. This displays the Create Operator Subscription page. Select your subscription settings, for example: Installation Mode > A specific namespace on the cluster > my-project Update Channel > stable Approval Strategy > Manual Click Subscribe. This displays the Operators > Installed Operators page. Wait a few moments until the Status for the Strimzi Operator displays Succeeded and the subscription is Up to Date. Additional resources Adding Operators to an OpenShift cluster Using AMQ Streams on OpenShift One of the available storage options requires that you provide connection information to a PostgreSQL database. You can use any PostgreSQL database available on your OpenShift cluster, but it is recommended to use OperatorHub to choose and install an Operator that can manage a PostgreSQL database for you. You can install your preferred PostgresQL Operator, but this section shows how to install the PostgreSQL Operator by Dev4Ddevs.com and create a new database for Apicurio Registry. Prerequisites You must have cluster administrator access to an OpenShift cluster. Procedure In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, log in using an account with cluster administrator privileges. Change to the OpenShift project in which Apicurio Registry is installed. For example, from the Project drop-down, select my-project. In the left navigation menu, click Operators > OperatorHub. In the Filter by keyword text box, enter PostgreSQL to find an Operator suitable for your environment, for example, PostgreSQL Operator by Dev4Ddevs.com or Crunchy PostgreSQL for OpenShift. Read the information about the Operator, and click Install. This displays the Create Operator Subscription page. Select your subscription settings, for example: Installation Mode: Select one of the following: All namespaces on the cluster (default) A specific namespace on the cluster and then my-project Update Channel > stable Approval Strategy: Select Automatic or Manual Click Subscribe. This displays the Operators > Installed Operators page. Wait a few moments until the Status for the PostgreSQL Operator displays Succeeded and the subscription is Up to Date. You must read the documentation from your chosen PostgreSQL Operator for details on how to create and manage your database. Create a PostgreSQL database for your Apicurio Registry storage. For example, click Installed Operators > PostgreSQL Operator by Dev4Ddevs.com > Create database > YAML. Edit the database settings as follows: name: Change the value to registry image: Change the value to centos/postgresql-10-centos7 Edit any other database settings as needed depending on your environment, for example: apiVersion: postgresql.dev4devs.com/v1alpha1 kind: Database metadata: name: registry namespace: my-project spec: databaseCpu: 30m databaseCpuLimit: 60m databaseMemoryLimit: 512Mi databaseMemoryRequest: 128Mi databaseName: example databaseNameKeyEnvVar: POSTGRESQL_DATABASE databasePassword: postgres databasePasswordKeyEnvVar: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD databaseStorageRequest: 1Gi databaseUser: postgres databaseUserKeyEnvVar: POSTGRESQL_USER image: centos/postgresql-10-centos7 size: 1 Click Create Database, and wait until the database is created.

Cannot modify global rules, perform import/export, or use /admin REST API endpoint. sr-readonly View and search only. Cannot modify artifacts or rules, perform import/export, or use /admin REST API endpoint. There is a related configuration option in the ApicurioRegistry CRD that you can use to set the web console to read-only mode. However, this configuration does not affect the REST API. Prerequisites You must have already installed the Apicurio Registry Operator. You must install the Keycloak Operator or have Keycloak accessible from your OpenShift cluster. The example configuration in this procedure is intended for development and testing only. To keep the procedure simple, it does not use HTTPS and other defenses recommended for a production environment. For more details, see the Keycloak documentation. Procedure In the OpenShift web console, click Installed Operators and Keycloak Operator, and then the Keycloak tab. Click Create Keycloak to provision a new Keycloak instance for securing a Apicurio Registry deployment. You can use the default value, for example: apiVersion: keycloak.org/v1alpha1 kind: Keycloak metadata: name: example-keycloak labels: app: sso spec: instances: 1 externalAccess: enabled: True podDisruptionBudget: enabled: True Wait until the instance has been created, and click Networking and then Routes to access the new route for the keycloak instance.

You can also create and manage realms using the Keycloak web console. If your cluster does not have a valid HTTPS certificate configured, you can create the following HTTP Service and Ingress resources as a temporary workaround: Click Networking and then Services, and click Create Service using the following example: apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: keycloak-http labels: app: keycloak spec: ports: - name: keycloak-http protocol: TCP port: 8080 targetPort: 8080 selector: app: keycloak component: keycloak type: ClusterIP sessionAffinity: None status: loadBalancer: {} Click Networking and then Ingresses, and click Create Ingress using the following example:: apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: keycloak-http labels: app: keycloak spec: rules: - host: keycloak-http.local http: paths: - path: / pathType: ImplementationSpecific backend: serviceName: keycloak-http servicePort: 8080 Modify the host value to create a route accessible for the Apicurio Registry user, and use it instead of the HTTPS route created by Keycloak Operator. Click the Apicurio Registry Operator, and on the ApicurioRegistry tab, click Create ApicurioRegistry, using the following example, but replace your values in the keycloak section. apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry metadata: name: example-apicurioregistry spec: configuration: security: keycloak: url: \"http://keycloak-http-.apps./auth\" # ^ Required # Keycloak server URL, must end with `/auth`. # Use an HTTP URL in development. realm: \"registry\" # apiClientId: \"registry-client-api\" # ^ Optional (default value) # uiClientId: \"registry-client-ui\" # ^ Optional (default value) Apicurio Registry Operator manages most common Apicurio Registry configuration, but there are some options that you can adjust manually. You can update these by setting an environment variable on the Apicurio Registry Deployment resource. If the specific configuration option is not available in the ApicurioRegistry CR, you can use an environment variable to adjust it. Procedure OpenShift web console Select the Installed Operators tab, and then the Red Hat Integration - Apicurio Registry Operator. On the Apicurio Registry tab, click the ApicurioRegistry CR for your Apicurio Registry deployment. On the main overview page, view the managedResources section, which contains the name of the Deployment managed by the Operator to deploy your Apicurio Registry instance. Find that Deployment in the Workloads > Deployments in the left menu. Select the Deployment with the correct name, and select the Environment tab. You can add or modify your environment variable to the Single values (env) section. Click Save at the bottom. OpenShift CLI Select the project where Apicurio Registry is installed. Run oc get apicurioregistry to get the list of ApicurioRegistry CRs Run oc describe on the CR representing the Apicurio Registry instance that you want to configure. View the managedResource in the status section. Find that Deployment and enter oc edit. Add or modify the environment variable in the spec.template.spec.containers[0].env section. Apicurio Registry provides readiness and liveness probes for OpenShift to ensure application health. These settings are configured to use reasonable defaults, but if you want to adjust them, this section provides details on the environment variables that you can configure. OpenShift liveness and readiness errors are explained as follows: Liveness error - the application cannot make progress, OpenShift restarts the failing pod. Readiness error - the application is not ready, for example, it is overwhelmed by requests. OpenShift stops sending requests to the pod for the time the probe fails. If other pods are OK, they still receive requests. Table 2. Apicurio Registry liveness environment variables Name Value type Description LIVENESS_ERROR_THRESHOLD Positive integer Number of liveness errors that can occur before the liveness probe fails. LIVENESS_COUNTER_RESET Positive integer, seconds Period in which the threshold number of errors must occur. For example, if this value is 60 and the threshold is 1, the check fails after two errors occur in 1 minute. LIVENESS_STATUS_RESET Positive integer, seconds Number of seconds that must elapse without any more errors for the liveness probe to reset to OK status. Because OpenShift restarts the pod that fails the liveness check, this value, unlike readiness, does not actually affect what happens. LIVENESS_ERRORS_IGNORED Comma-separated list of fully qualified exception class names. List of errors that are ignored for liveness checking purposes. Table 3. Apicurio Registry readiness environment variables Name Value type Description READINESS_ERROR_THRESHOLD Positive integer Number of readiness errors that can occur before the readiness probe fails. READINESS_COUNTER_RESET Positive integer, seconds Period in which the threshold number of errors must occur. For example, if this value is 60 and the threshold is 1, the check fails after two errors occur in 1 minute. READINESS_STATUS_RESET Positive integer, seconds Number of seconds that must elapse without any more errors for the readiness probe to reset to OK status. In practice, this value means how long the pod remains in an unready state until it returns to normal operation. READINESS_TIMEOUT positive integer, seconds The readiness system tracks the timeout of two operations: how long it takes for a storage request to complete, and how long it takes for an HTTP REST API request to return a response. If the operation takes more time, it is counted as a readiness error. This value controls those timeouts. The following procedure shows how to configure Apicurio Registry deployment to expose a port for HTTPS connections from inside the OpenShift cluster. This kind of connection is not directly available outside of the cluster. Routing is based on hostname, which is encoded in the case of an HTTPS connection. Therefore, edge termination or other configuration is still needed. See Configuring an HTTPS connection to Apicurio Registry from outside the OpenShift cluster. Prerequisites You must have already installed the Apicurio Registry Operator. Procedure Generate a keystore with a self-signed certificate. You can skip this step if you are using your own certificates. keytool -genkey -trustcacerts -keyalg RSA -keystore registry-keystore.jks -storepass password Create a new secret to hold the keystore and keystore password. In the left navigation menu of the OpenShift web console, click Workloads > Secrets > Create Key/Value Secret. Use the following values: Name: registry-keystore Key 1: keystore.jks Value 1: registry-keystore.jks (uploaded file) Key 2: password Value 2: password If you encounter a java.io.IOException: Invalid keystore format, the upload of the binary file did not work properly. As an alternative, encode the file as a base64 string using cat registry-keystore.jks | base64 -w0 > data.txt and edit the Secret resource as yaml to manually add the encoded file. Edit the Deployment resource of the Apicurio Registry instance. You can find the correct name in a status field of the Apicurio Registry Operator. Add the keystore secret as a volume: template: spec: volumes: - name: registry-keystore-secret-volume secret: secretName: registry-keystore Add a volume mount: volumeMounts: - name: registry-keystore-secret-volume mountPath: /etc/registry-keystore readOnly: true Add JAVA_OPTIONS and KEYSTORE_PASSWORD environment variables: - name: KEYSTORE_PASSWORD valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: registry-keystore key: password - name: JAVA_OPTIONS value: >- -Dquarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-file=/etc/registry-keystore/keystore.jks -Dquarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-file-type=jks -Dquarkus.http.ssl.certificate.key-store-password=$(KEYSTORE_PASSWORD) Order is important when using string interpolation. Enable the HTTPS port: ports: - containerPort: 8080 protocol: TCP - containerPort: 8443 protocol: TCP Edit the Service resource of the Apicurio Registry instance. You can find the correct name in a status field of the Apicurio Registry Operator. ports: - name: http protocol: TCP port: 8080 targetPort: 8080 - name: https protocol: TCP port: 8443 targetPort: 8443 Verify that the connection is working: Connect into a pod on the cluster using SSH (you can use the Apicurio Registry pod): oc rsh -n default example-apicurioregistry-deployment-vx28s-4-lmtqb Find the cluster IP of the Apicurio Registry pod from the Service resource (see the Location column in the web console). Afterwards, execute a test request (we are using self-signed certificate, so an insecure flag is required): curl -k https://172.30.209.198:8443/health [...] The following procedure shows how to configure Apicurio Registry deployment to expose an HTTPS edge-terminated route for connections from outside the OpenShift cluster. Prerequisites You must have already installed the Apicurio Registry Operator. Read the OpenShift documentation for creating secured routes. Procedure Add a second Route in addition to the HTTP route created by the Apicurio Registry Operator. See the following example: kind: Route apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1 metadata: [...] labels: app: example-apicurioregistry [...] spec: host: example-apicurioregistry-default.apps.example.com to: kind: Service name: example-apicurioregistry-service-9whd7 weight: 100 port: targetPort: 8080 tls: termination: edge insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect wildcardPolicy: None Make sure the insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect configuration property is set. If you do not specify a certificate, OpenShift will use a default. You can alternatively generate a custom self-signed certificate using the following commands: openssl genrsa 2048 > host.key && openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -key host.key -out host.cert and then create a route using the OpenShift CLI: oc create route edge \\ --service=example-apicurioregistry-service-9whd7 \\ --cert=host.cert --key=host.key \\ --hostname=example-apicurioregistry-default.apps.example.com \\ --insecure-policy=Redirect \\ -n default When using storage in a PostgreSQL database, you must ensure that the data stored by Apicurio Registry is backed up regularly. SQL Dump is a simple procedure that works with any PostgreSQL installation. This uses the pg_dump utility to generate a file with SQL commands that you can use to recreate the database in the same state that it was in at the time of the dump. pg_dump is a regular PostgreSQL client application, which you can execute from any remote host that has access to the database. Like any other client, the operations that can perform are limited to the user permissions. Procedure Use the pg_dump command to redirect the output to a file: $ pg_dump dbname > dumpfile You can specify the database server that pg_dump connects to using the -h host and -p port options. You can reduce large dump files using a compression tool, such as gzip, for example: $ pg_dump dbname | gzip > filename.gz Additional resources For details on client authentication, see the PostgreSQL documentation. For details on importing and exporting registry content, see Managing Apicurio Registry content using the REST API. You can restore SQL Dump files created by pg_dump using the psql utility. Prerequisites You must have already backed up your PostgreSQL datbase using pg_dump. See Backing up Apicurio Registry PostgreSQL storage. All users who own objects or have permissions on objects in the dumped database must already exist.

If you are deploying to Kubernetes, you can use command line tools to perform the equivalent steps. The Apicurio Registry Operator supports the same configuration options on OpenShift and Kubernetes. The main decision to make when deploying Apicurio Registry is which storage backend to use. The following storage options are available: In-memory - data is stored in RAM on each Apicurio Registry node. This is the easiest deployment to use, but is not recommended for production environment. Apache Kafka (Kafka + SQL) - data is stored using Apache Kafka, with the help of local SQL database on each node. SQL (PostgreSQL) - data is stored in a relational database, in this case PostgreSQL 12+. Storage requiring installation The following options require that the storage is already installed as a prerequisite: Apache Kafka SQL (PostgreSQL) Additional resources Installing Apicurio Registry Operator using the OperatorHub The in-memory storage option uses RAM to store the data on nodes where Apicurio Registry is deployed, and it is the simplest persistence option to use. The Apicurio Registry Operator will deploy Apicurio Registry in this way if you do not provide any configuration in the ApicurioRegistry CR: apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry metadata: name: example-apicurioregistry-mem spec: configuration: persistence: \"mem\" # Optional (default value) # NOTE: No additional configuration required for *dev* deployment Prerequisites You must have an Kubernetes cluster with cluster administrator access. You must have already installed the Apicurio Registry Operator. Procedure Deploy the example CR using following commands: export NAMESPACE=\"default\" curl -sSL \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apicurio/apicurio-registry-operator/v1.0.0/docs/modules/ROOT/examples/apicurioregistry_mem_cr.yaml\" | kubectl apply -f - -n $NAMESPACE This persistence option does not support data distribution across Apicurio Registry nodes. Therefore, it is only recommended for development environments using a single replica (Pod). Use embedded Infinispan persistence option when deploying multiple replicas. You can configure the Strimzi Operator and Apicurio Registry Operator to use a default connection with no security. Prerequisites You must install the Apicurio Registry Operator using the OperatorHub or command line. You must install the Strimzi Operator or have Kafka accessible from your OpenShift cluster. Procedure In the OpenShift web console, click Installed Operators, select the Strimzi Operator details, and then the Kafka tab. Click Create Kafka to provision a new Kafka cluster for Apicurio Registry storage. You can use the default value, for example: apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2 kind: Kafka metadata: name: my-cluster namespace: registry-example-kafkasql-plain # Change or remove the explicit namespace spec: kafka: config: offsets.topic.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.min.isr: 2 log.message.format.version: '2.7' inter.broker.protocol.version: '2.7' version: 2.7.0 storage: type: ephemeral replicas: 3 listeners: - name: plain port: 9092 type: internal tls: false - name: tls port: 9093 type: internal tls: true entityOperator: topicOperator: {} userOperator: {} zookeeper: storage: type: ephemeral replicas: 3 Your OpenShift project namespace might be different. When the cluster is ready, open the Kafka resource, examine the status block, and copy the bootstrapServers value for later use when deploying Apicurio Registry. For example: status: conditions: ... listeners: - addresses: - host: my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.registry-example-kafkasql-plain.svc port: 9092 bootstrapServers: 'my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.registry-example-kafkasql-plain.svc:9092' type: plain ... The default Kafka topic name that Apicurio Registry uses to store data is kafkasql-journal. This topic is created automatically by Apicurio Registry. You can override this behavior or the default topic name by setting the appropriate environment variables (default values): REGISTRY_KAFKASQL_TOPIC_AUTO_CREATE=true REGISTRY_KAFKASQL_TOPIC=kafkasql-journal If you decide not to create the Kafka topic manually, skip the next step. Click the Kafka Topic tab, and then Create Kafka Topic to create the kafkasql-journal topic: apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1 kind: KafkaTopic metadata: name: kafkasql-journal labels: strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster namespace: registry-example-kafkasql-plain spec: partitions: 2 replicas: 1 config: retention.ms: 604800000 segment.bytes: 1073741824 Select the Apicurio Registry Operator, and in the ApicurioRegistry tab, click Create ApicurioRegistry, using the following example, but replace your value in the bootstrapServers field. apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry metadata: name: example-apicurioregistry-kafkasql spec: configuration: persistence: \"kafkasql\" kafkasql: bootstrapServers: \"my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.registry-example-kafkasql-plain.svc:9092\" Wait a few minutes to see the Route being created, where you can access the application. You can configure the Strimzi Operator and Apicurio Registry Operator to use an encrypted Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection. Prerequisites You must install the Apicurio Registry Operator using the OperatorHub or command line. You must install the Strimzi Operator or have Kafka accessible from your OpenShift cluster. This section assumes that the Strimzi Operator is available, however you can use any Kafka deployment. In that case, you must manually create the Openshift secrets that the Apicurio Registry Operator expects. Procedure In the OpenShift web console, click Installed Operators, select the Strimzi Operator details, and then the Kafka tab. Click Create Kafka to provision a new Kafka cluster for Apicurio Registry storage. Configure the authorization and tls fields to use TLS authentication for the Kafka cluster, for example: apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2 kind: Kafka metadata: name: my-cluster namespace: registry-example-kafkasql-tls # Change or remove the explicit namespace spec: kafka: config: offsets.topic.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 3 transaction.state.log.min.isr: 2 log.message.format.version: '2.7' inter.broker.protocol.version: '2.7' version: 2.7.0 storage: type: ephemeral replicas: 3 listeners: - name: tls port: 9093 type: internal tls: true authentication: type: tls authorization: type: simple entityOperator: topicOperator: {} userOperator: {} zookeeper: storage: type: ephemeral replicas: 3 The default Kafka topic name that Apicurio Registry uses to store data is kafkasql-journal. This topic is created automatically by Apicurio Registry. You can override this behavior or the default topic name by setting the appropriate environment variables (default values): REGISTRY_KAFKASQL_TOPIC_AUTO_CREATE=true REGISTRY_KAFKASQL_TOPIC=kafkasql-journal If you decide not to create the Kafka topic manually, skip the next step. Click the Kafka Topic tab, and then Create Kafka Topic to create the kafkasql-journal topic: apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1 kind: KafkaTopic metadata: name: kafkasql-journal labels: strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster namespace: registry-example-kafkasql-tls spec: partitions: 2 replicas: 1 config: retention.ms: 604800000 segment.bytes: 1073741824 Create a Kafka User resource to configure authentication and authorization for the Apicurio Registry user. You can specify a user name in the metadata section or use the default my-user. apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1 kind: KafkaUser metadata: name: my-user labels: strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster namespace: registry-example-kafkasql-tls spec: authentication: type: tls authorization: acls: - operation: All resource: name: '*' patternType: literal type: topic - operation: All resource: name: '*' patternType: literal type: cluster - operation: All resource: name: '*' patternType: literal type: transactionalId - operation: All resource: name: '*' patternType: literal type: group type: simple You must configure the authorization specifically for the topics and resources that the Apicurio Registry requires. This is a simple permissive example. Click Workloads and then Secrets to find two secrets that Strimzi creates for Apicurio Registry to connect to the Kafka cluster: my-cluster-cluster-ca-cert - contains the PKCS12 truststore for the Kafka cluster my-user - contains the user’s keystore The name of the secret can vary based on your cluster or user name. If you create the secrets manually, they must contain the following key-value pairs: my-cluster-ca-cert ca.p12 - truststore in PKCS12 format ca.password - truststore password my-user user.p12 - keystore in PKCS12 format user.password - keystore password Configure the following example configuration to deploy the Apicurio Registry. apiVersion: registry.apicur.io/v1 kind: ApicurioRegistry metadata: name: example-apicurioregistry-kafkasql spec: configuration: persistence: \"kafkasql\" kafkasql: bootstrapServers: \"my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.registry-example-kafkasql-tls.svc:9093\" security: tls: keystoreSecretName: my-user truststoreSecretName: my-cluster-cluster-ca-cert You must use a different bootstrapServers address than in the plain insecure use case. The address must support TLS connections and is found in the specified Kafka resource under the type: tls field. You can configure the Strimzi Operator and Apicurio Registry Operator to use Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM-SHA-512) for the Kafka cluster. Prerequisites You must install the Apicurio Registry Operator using the OperatorHub or command line. You must install the Strimzi Operator or have Kafka accessible from your OpenShift cluster. This section assumes that Strimzi Operator is available, however you can use any Kafka deployment.
